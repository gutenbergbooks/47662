SIR WILLIAM WALLACE.</h2>

<hr />

<h2 title="CHAPTER I"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="subhead">WALLACE APPOINTED GUARDIAN OF THE KINGDOM.&mdash;INVADES
ENGLAND.&mdash;INROAD OF DE CLIFFORD ON THE SOUTH OF
SCOTLAND.</span></h2>

<p>Stirling Castle capitulated immediately after
the battle, and Sir Marmaduke <span class="locked">Twenge,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> who
had taken shelter in it, was sent prisoner to Dumbarton.
The surrender of the castle of Dundee
followed; and, with the exception of the garrisons
remaining in Roxburgh, Berwick, and Dunbar,
Scotland was once more completely cleared
of her invaders. These places, with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of the last, were also given up, as soon as they
were summoned by the leaders of the Scottish army;
and about this time, at a meeting held in the
Forest-kirk, Selkirkshire, Wallace was elected, or
declared Regent of Scotland, in the name of King
John; the appointment being sanctioned by the
presence of the Earl of Lennox, Sir William Douglas,
and a number of the most powerful among
the nobility.</p>

<p>Thus armed with legitimate authority, the newly
appointed Guardian began to exercise it in the
manner that he conceived would be most conducive
to the general interest and welfare of the country.
He had often experienced the difficulties which
feudal vassalage presented to his efforts in behalf
of the national independence. The numerous serfs
who were retained in bondage by the more powerful
barons, could be either restrained from taking
up arms, or withdrawn at the caprice of their
masters, even when their services were of the
greatest importance. A power so dangerous in
the hands of a party comparatively small, had been
productive of the most ruinous consequences. To
reform a system pregnant with mischief, and one
at the same time so much in favour with the
prejudices of the age, required wisdom and energy,
such as he possessed. Aware of the opposition
which an open and declared attempt to emancipate
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">adscripti glebæ</i> would create,&mdash;he attacked
the system in the only part where it appeared
to be vulnerable. Having divided the country
into districts, he caused a muster-roll to be
made out, containing the names of all who were
capable of bearing arms between the age of sixteen
and sixty. These he divided and subdivided in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
manner peculiarly his own. Over every four men
he appointed a fifth; over every nine, a tenth;
over every nineteen, a twentieth; and thus continued
the gradation of rank till it reached the chiliarch,
or commander of a <span class="locked">thousand.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> In the
different parishes, gibbets were also erected to enforce
obedience to these regulations; and whoever
refused to appear for the defence of his country
when summoned, was hung up as an example to
others. Those barons who interposed their authority
to prevent their vassals from joining the ranks
of the patriots, were either punished with imprisonment,
or confiscation of property.</p>

<p>Though the active and restless mind of Wallace
may now seem to have had full employment in the various
duties of his office,&mdash;yet, amidst the multiplicity
of objects of internal policy which occupied his
time, the resuscitation of the foreign trade of the
kingdom appears to have had its proper share of his
attention. The advantage which Scotland derived
from her foreign commercial intercourse, as has been
already stated, was too important to be soon forgotten;
and the heroic and faithful conduct of the
Flemings at the siege of Berwick, was too recent
not to be dwelt on with grateful remembrance. In
order, therefore, to renew the connection with
those useful strangers, accredited persons appear
to have been despatched with letters to the free
towns of Hamburg and <span class="locked">Lubeck.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span></p>

<p>Having provided for the necessary supplies of
men, the Guardian determined on retaliating the
injuries Scotland had sustained at the hands of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
late oppressors. Meanwhile a famine,&mdash;the natural
consequence of the neglect of agriculture during
the unsettled state of the country, had begun to
make its appearance; and was soon followed by
a pestilence,&mdash;occasioned, doubtless, by the multitude
of putrid carcasses which remained, partially
at least, if not altogether, exposed after the recent
carnage. To alleviate, as far as possible, the misery
consequent on those dreaded calamities, he
commanded all the standing crops to be carefully
gathered in, and stored up in barns and yards
under proper regulations, to meet the exigencies
of the country during winter. In order, at the
same time, to concentrate the strength and resources
of the country, and establish that unanimity
so necessary for its defence, he summoned all the
vassals of the Scottish crown to meet him at Perth.
From this parliament, which was pretty numerously
attended, Patrick, Earl of Dunbar, thought
proper to absent himself. The great power and
military experience of this baron, joined to the circumstance
of his occupying a fortress which was
considered as the key of the <i>eastern</i> part of the
kingdom, made it an object of some importance
that his allegiance should be unquestionable. An
early partisan of Edward, he had as yet shown no
disposition to relinquish his unnatural connection
with the enemy. When the subject of his absence
came, therefore, to be discussed before the Scottish
Nobles, they unanimously resolved on proceeding
against him without delay. Wallace,
however, proposed the more gentle expedient of
remonstrance, before having recourse to extremities;
and a deputation was accordingly sent, to
request his attendance as a Scottish Peer, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to take part in the government of the country, and
to aid, with his counsel and his arms, in the establishment
of the national independence. Possessed
of large dominions in England, as well as an
extensive inheritance in Scotland, this Earl felt
little inclination to incur the displeasure of his
Lord Paramount in the South, by a too ready accession
to the cause of liberty in the North; and he
accordingly returned a haughty and scornful answer,
no way calculated to allay the prejudice which his
former contemptuous behaviour had excited against
him. As soon, therefore, as the various objects
which had engaged the attention of the parliament
were disposed of, Wallace proceeded, with a select
body of four hundred men, to reduce the turbulent
chieftain. A little to the east of Dunbar, the
Guardian found the Earl awaiting his approach at
the head of nine hundred followers; and a desperate
conflict immediately commenced, which
ended in the flight of Patrick, who escaped to
<span class="locked">England.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> The castle of Dunbar was in consequence
surrendered to the victor, who gave it in
charge to Sir Christopher Seton, with a competent
garrison for its defence.</p>

<p>1297. Early in October a proclamation was issued
for every one capable of bearing arms to appear on
the moor of Roslin. An immense multitude attended.
The most vigorous and the best equipped
were then selected; and having thus embodied an
efficient, numerous, and gallant army, Wallace excited
their ardour by a short and animating address,
in which he told them, that, united as they were,
with only one glorious object in view, they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
nothing but victory to expect,&mdash;their country had
been stript of its wealth by their late oppressors,
and it was now their duty and interest to recover
it, and punish the aggressors. The <span class="locked">army<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> then proceeded
in high spirits towards the English frontier,&mdash;their
leader rightly judging, that, by withdrawing
so many men, a larger quantity of provisions
would remain for those left behind; and by adopting
this measure, his soldiers also, while they escaped
from the contagion which had appeared in Scotland,
would be moreover rewarded for their past
labours, by the riches they would find in the more
flourishing regions of the South; which, having
enjoyed a long interval of peace, might be conceived
to be overflowing with that description of
wealth most desirable in the estimation of the
needy adventurers of the North;&mdash;and the latter,
no doubt, as they drove home their lowing and
bleating prey from the rich pastures of Durham
and the neighbouring counties, considered that they
were merely removing their own property, of which
they had been unjustly deprived by the tyranny
of the English.</p>

<p>In this expedition, Wallace divided the command
of the army with Sir Andrew Murray of
Bothwell, the promising son of the brave Sir Andrew,
who fell in the late engagement. This honour
he may have thought due to the patriotic
conduct of the father, in adhering to the fortunes
of his country, amidst the general defection of the
Scottish barons. And&mdash;as it might tend to give the
<i>lie</i> to those reports which began to be circulated of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
an intention to aggrandize himself at the expense
of the aristocracy,&mdash;the appointment was evidently
a measure of judicious and honourable policy.</p>

<p>On the approach of the Scottish army, the inhabitants
of Northumberland deserted their dwellings,
and fled to Newcastle, carrying with them
their wives and children, their cattle and household
stuff. The Guardian, however, for a short time delayed
his advance; and having received notice that
several of the burgesses of Aberdeen, and others
in that quarter, had disobeyed his summons to appear
at Roslin, he hurried back to the North, where,
on apprehending the parties, those whose excuses
were inadmissible, he ordered for immediate execution.
Hastily rejoining his forces, he crossed
the Border, and succeeded in surprising the English,
who, thinking the storm had blown over, were
returned to their homes.</p>

<p>The Scots now commenced their destructive reprisals,
by wasting with fire and sword the counties
of Cumberland and Northumberland. In this
work of devastation they were assisted by Robert
de Ros of Werk, a great northern baron, who, as
we have already observed, had deserted the standard
of Edward in 1295. It is presumed that
the same influence which formerly seduced him
from his loyalty, still existed; and it is a pity that
the name of the lady who made so patriotic a use
of her charms, has not been preserved by the historians
of her country.</p>

<p>The former inroads of the Scots were trifling,
compared with the wide-spreading desolation which
now marked their career. The havoc they made,
and the spoils they collected, are feelingly dwelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
on by the English writers of the day. Langtoft

<p>Hemingford says, “At this time the praise of
God was not heard in any church or monastery
through the whole country, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne
to the gates of Carlisle; for the monks and
canons regular, and other priests who were ministers
of the Lord, fled with the whole people from
the face of the enemy; nor was there any to oppose
them, except now and then a few English
who belonged to the Castle of Alnwick, who ventured
from their strongholds, and slew some stragglers.
But these were but slight successes; and
the Scots roved over the <span class="locked">country<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> from the Feast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
of St Luke to St Martin’s day, inflicting on it all
the miseries of rapine and <span class="locked">bloodshed.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p>

<p>The Guardian having summoned in all his plundering
parties, and concentrated his army, directed
his march towards Carlisle. The sack of this city
would have been most desirable to the invaders, not
only on account of its riches, but also as in some
measure enabling them to avenge the injuries inflicted
upon Berwick. The place, however, was
strongly fortified; and the Scots not being provided
with a battering train, they had to content
themselves with sending a summons; which, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
disregarded by the garrison, they passed on, and
laid waste Cumberland and Allerdale, from Inglewood
Forest to Derwentwater and Cockermouth.
Winter now advanced:&mdash;the frost set in with
uncommon severity,&mdash;and the Scots, who had created
a desert around them, began also to dread
the miseries of famine, as well as the inclemency
of the season. Their encampments could now be
traced by the frozen bodies of those who had perished
during the night from the intensity of the
cold. Under these circumstances, Wallace gave
orders for their return to Scotland.</p>

<p>On their reaching <span class="locked">Hexceldsham,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> the monastery
of which had been plundered during their advance,
the following singular scene is said by Hemmingford
to have occurred. Three monks, all who had
the courage to remain, were observed in a small
chapel. Thinking that the danger was over, they
had forsaken their concealments, and were endeavouring
to repair the damages of the late visitation,
when, in the midst of their labours, they discovered
the Scottish army returning, and fled in
dismay to the oratory. The soldiers, however,
with their long spears, were soon among them;
and brandishing their weapons, commanded them,
at their peril, to give up the treasures of the monastery.
“Alas!” said one of the monks, “it is
but a short time since you yourselves have seized
our whole property, and you know best where it
now is.” At this juncture Wallace entered, and
commanding his soldiers to be silent, requested
one of the monks to perform mass: he obeyed,
and the Guardian and his attendants heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
service with becoming reverence. When the elevation
of the host was about to take place, Wallace
retired for a moment to lay aside his helmet and
arms. Instantly the avarice and ferocity of the
soldiers broke out. They pressed upon the priest,
snatched the cup from the high altar, tore away
the ornaments and sacred vestments, and even
stole the book which contained the ceremony.
When their leader returned, he found the priest
in fear and horror at the sacrilege. Wallace, indignant
at such conduct, gave orders that the villains
should be searched for, and put to death. In
the mean time, he took the monks under his own
special protection.</p>

<p>As some atonement for the outrage committed,
the Guardian granted to the monks of Hexceldsham
a charter of protection for twelve months,
from the 7th November <span class="locked">1297,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> by which their
lives and property were held sacred. “The prohibition,”
says Lord Hailes, “to slay any ecclesiastic
of the monastery of Hexceldsham, shows
that the Scots had been guilty of uncommon barbarities.”
Had his Lordship said that the conduct
of the Scots was merely an humble imitation
of the example which the English had set them in
their “Good Friday” <i>revelries</i> at the sack of
Berwick, he would have been nearer the truth.
We find no such restraint put upon the English
soldiery, who were allowed to murder their lay
and clerical victims indiscriminately; not even
excepting nuns, whose sex, independent of every
other consideration, ought to have been their protection.
If a shadow of humanity can be discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
in the mode of warfare carried on by the two
nations, it certainly belongs of right to those who
published a prohibition of such enormities. In
the invasion by the Scots in 1296, there is no
charge brought against them of killing priests.
Langtoft says, vol. ii. p. 273, that in coming to
Hexham and Leynertofte, they merely chased out
the chanons, and took away their goods. Their
subsequent severity must therefore have been
forced upon them by their enemies.</p>

<p>English writers have lamented, with eloquence
and pathos, the cruelties exercised in this invasion;
and from their silence respecting the atrocities of
their own countrymen, have endeavoured to fix
the stain of exclusive barbarity on the arms of
Scotland. This is all natural enough, and quite
consistent with that national prejudice by which
the people of every country are more or less imbued;
but it is painfully mortifying, when we
find Scotchmen of acknowledged talent and penetration
forgetting what is due to themselves and
to their country; and from a weak fear of being
thought illiberal, following humbly in the train of
such authors, and echoing their reflections; or favouringly
assenting to their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex parte</i> statements, in
place of standing forward and showing the world,
that their countrymen, in resorting to such severities,
merely exercised a system of fair retaliation,
for the purpose of repressing enormities of the
deepest dye, committed in support of an aggression
of the most unparalleled baseness.</p>

<p>During the time the Scottish army was engaged
in ravaging the northern counties of England, Robert
de Clifford, at the head of one hundred men-at-arms,
and twenty thousand foot, left Carlisle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
and proceeded to plunder in Scotland. His success,
however, was not great, having killed three
hundred and eight Scots, burned two villages, and
taken a few prisoners, with whom he returned
home about Christmas.</p>

<p>Whilst the Guardian was thus successfully prosecuting
the cause of his country’s independence,
his efforts, at the same time, were becoming daily
more beneficial to the real liberties of the very
people to whom he was opposed. Elated, first by
the conquest of Wales, and afterwards by that of
Scotland, Edward had already begun to stretch forth
the iron road of oppression over the legitimate
subjects of his own native kingdom; and, trusting
to the assistance he should receive from the barons
of his newly acquired conquests, who, he might
naturally suppose would not be found reluctant to
act as instruments in holding their late conquerors
in subjection, he assumed, towards the nobles of
England, an air of haughty superiority that awakened
their jealousy, and alarmed their fears.
But as the investigation of this subject would interrupt
the course of our narrative, we shall reserve
it till the end of the <span class="locked">volume.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span></p>

AT STANMORE.&mdash;BATTLE OF BLACKIRONSIDE.&mdash;LEGALITY OF
WALLACE’S REGENCY.&mdash;EDWARD INVADES SCOTLAND.&mdash;TREACHERY
OF TWO SCOTTISH NOBLEMEN.</span></h2>

<p>During the time that Wallace remained in England,
his army was occasionally renewed; for as
soon as the quota of men belonging to one clan or
parish had collected a sufficient share of booty,
they were allowed to retire and secure it in the
North, while their places were supplied by fresh
hordes of not less hungry adventurers. By such
means the spoil of England became pretty equally
divided throughout the several districts of Scotland,
and the inhabitants began to experience the benefits
of returning plenty. Having, in this manner,
enriched his own country at the expense of her enemies,
the intrepid Guardian returned&mdash;poor it is
true, in wealth, but rich in fame&mdash;to behold the
prosperity he had so gallantly <span class="locked">achieved.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
expedition, however, though it had increased his
reputation among the common people, failed not
to awaken the envy of the nobles, who could ill
brook the popularity of one whose actions had
thrown them so much into the shade; and his praise,
which they heard on all sides, sounded in their
ears like so many reproaches against themselves,
who, possessing wealth and power, either could not,
or from treachery would not, do what he, so much
their inferior in wealth and influence, had taken
in hand and finished, with glory to himself and honour
to the country. Hence the private heart-burnings
which arose among these noblemen, whose
consciences whispered that they had been either
traitors or sluggards when the liberty of their
country was at stake.</p>

<p>1298. In the mean time, Edward having complied
with the demands of his subjects, the Barons
of England collected an army, and advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
towards the Border. On the 14th March, the King
himself landed at Sandwich, and instantly summoned
the Scottish barons to a Parliament at York.
According to Abercrombie, he also addressed letters
to the Guardian, and in a strain more impassioned
than courteous, upbraided him for his audacity in
disturbing the tranquillity of Scotland, and in presuming
afterwards to invade England,&mdash;a line of
conduct which, he observed, would not have been
ventured upon, had he (Edward) been in the country;
and concluded, by commanding Wallace to redeem
his errors by an immediate submission to
his authority. To these letters the Guardian replied,
that in availing himself of the absence of
Edward, in order to regain the liberty of his country,
he had done no more than his duty, and that
the baseness lay with the English monarch in taking
advantage of the disunion of a free people to
enslave them. As to invading England, he had
done so in order to indemnify Scotland for the
injuries she had so unjustly sustained; and in respect
to submission, as he intended soon to be in
England again, he would then give him his answer
in person.</p>

<p>The active and undaunted Guardian was instantly
at the heels of his messenger, and on the 20th
March came in sight of the English army at Stanmore.
Scottish historians say, that Edward’s
force though much superior to that of Wallace, was
composed chiefly of raw militia hastily raised, few
or none of his veterans having been yet landed, and
that the English monarch, struck with the appearance
and admirable discipline of the Scots,
and, unwilling to risk his fame in a conflict so
doubtful,&mdash;when about five hundred paces from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the enemy, turned his banners and marched off
the field. Wallace, afraid of an ambush, restrained
his soldiers from the pursuit, and repressed their
ardour by telling them, that the victory they had
already gained was the more glorious, as it was
got without blood and against the first captain of
the age, at the head of an army which, to all human
appearance, was able, from its numbers, to
have swallowed them up; concluding his address,
by ordering thanksgivings to Heaven for so great
an interposition in their favour.</p>

<p>This account, however, is not corroborated by
English historians. They allege that the King was
not present; and in this they are certainly in the
right. Edward, on his arrival in England, was
detained by matters of importance, in such a manner
as to render his presence at Stanmore on the
20th March utterly impossible. That the Scots
may have come in sight of the English army on
the borders, is not at all unlikely; or that the latter
should decline risking a general engagement,
after their late reverses, without the presence of
their King, who was daily expected, is extremely
probable. It may also be observed, that the charters
of their rights, though granted at Ghent, had
not as yet been confirmed in England. The conduct
of the English leaders, under such circumstances,
may be considered as highly prudent and
judicious.</p>

<p>But if the Scots were disappointed in <i>not</i> coming
to blows with their enemies at Stanmore, it was not
long before they had an opportunity of trying the
mettle of their swords. Aymer, or Aldomer de
Vallance, son of the Earl Pembroke, a youth at
that time of eighteen years, had raised himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
high in the estimation of Edward, by the ready
manner in which he accompanied him to Flanders.
The abilities and discretion, which he soon displayed,
obtained for him so much of the confidence
of his master, that he was employed in various
important matters of state. On the truce
with France being concluded&mdash;for the furtherance
of which he was appointed a commissioner&mdash;Edward,
it appears, had ordered him to sail for Scotland
with the force under his command, for the
purpose of co-operating in the invasion which he
meditated on his arrival in England. Various circumstances
contributed to retard the projected attempt;
and it was not till midsummer that Aldomer
and Sir John Siward (a recreant Scot, son
of the traitor of Dunbar) landed in Fife with a considerable
body of troops, and began to lay waste
the country. Their destructive operations, however,
were soon interrupted by the arrival of Wallace
and his Scots, who fell upon them in the extensive
forest of Blackironside, and, after an obstinate
conflict, the invaders were defeated with the
loss of 1580 men. This engagement, which is
sometimes called the Battle of Dillecarew, was
fought on the 12th June. The loss of the Scots
was comparatively trifling; and, with the exception
of Sir Duncan Balfour, Sheriff of Fife, and
according to some, Sir Christopher <span class="locked">Seton,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> few,
if any, of note, were killed,&mdash;Sir John Graham
being only wounded. Sir John Ramsay of Auchterhouse,
with Squires Guthrie and <span class="locked">Bisset<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
particularly mentioned as having distinguished
themselves in this brilliant rencounter.</p>

<p>On his return to Scotland, after the affair at
Stanmore, Wallace applied himself to rectify the
abuses and disorders which had arisen from the
disorganized state of the country. For this purpose,
he seems to have made a tour through
the kingdom, and on 29th March we find him
presiding in an assembly of the Barons at Torphichen.
At this assembly, which was most probably
held in the preceptory of the Templars,
various meritorious individuals were rewarded for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
their patriotic exertions in the cause of independence.
Among those, Alexander Scrymgeour had
the constabulary of Dundee conferred upon him
<i>and his heirs, for his “faithful aid in bearing the
Royal Banner of Scotland, which service he actually
performs</i>.” This document appears to have
been made with the consent and approbation of
the Scottish nobility, and is dated 29th March
<span class="locked">1298.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Some authors assert, that the election of Wallace
to the Guardianship took place after his return
from the invasion of England. Lord Hailes says,
he <i>assumed</i> the title of Guardian subsequent to
that event. This we consider extremely improbable;
as the degree of popularity he had attained
among his countrymen would have certainly
anticipated any assumption on the part of their
deliverer. Although Abercromby be not a first-rate
authority, we conceive that he is right in
placing the election before the advance of Wallace
to the south. The immense preparations necessary
for an invasion of England, required the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
sanction of something like legitimate authority to
carry it into effect; and the measures which he resorted
to for the good of the country, immediately
posterior to the battle of Stirling, were not of a
less decisive character than those which marked
his policy on his return from England. Abercromby
also states, that he held a commission of
Regency under the seal of <span class="locked">Baliol,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> which was
privately executed during the captivity of the latter
in the Tower of London. To this statement,
tradition unites her testimony, and adds, that Wallace
likewise obtained a bond from the principal
barons of Scotland, authorizing any measures he
might adopt for the recovery of the kingdom.
This bond, it is asserted, he held <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in terrorem</i> over
the heads of the aristocracy, for the purpose of
compelling them to their duty.</p>

<p>The authority of Wallace, however, whether
<i>conferred</i> or <i>assumed</i>, unfortunately for his country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
was not destined to be of long duration. Soon
after the defeat of the Earl of Pembroke, Edward,
now reconciled to his barons, entered Scotland by
the eastern marches, with a formidable army, consisting,
according to English writers, of 3000 horsemen,
armed at all points, 4000 of a lighter description,
called <i>hobelars</i>, and 80,000 foot. A
further reinforcement overtook him on his march,
which swelled his forces to upwards of 100,000
fighting men, a great proportion of whom were
veterans, inured to arms in the French wars. To
oppose a power so overwhelming in the open field,
the Guardian well knew would be in vain; he,
therefore, again resorted to those measures which
had already been found so effective: the population
retired with their cattle and provisions before
the approaching enemy, after destroying whatever
they conceived might be useful to the invaders.
While the Scottish army kept far in the advance,
a strict <i>surveillance</i> was exercised over the
motions of their adversaries, so that few of the
English scouts were able to return with any satisfactory
account of the position or numbers of
their opponents; and though most of the fortified
places made little or no resistance, yet the
supplies the conquerors found in the garrisons,
did little to relieve that scarcity which soon began
to be severely felt among the multitudes who followed
the banner of England.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the fleet which Edward had
ordered to attend him with provisions being detained
by contrary winds, he was compelled to
wait their arrival; and, for this purpose, he fixed
his head-quarters in the preceptory of the Knights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Templars at <span class="locked">Torphichen;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> while part of his army
occupied Temple-liston, thus keeping open his
communication with the sea.</p>

<p>Edward, in his march, had met with little annoyance,
except from the stronghold of Dirleton, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
two other castles in his rear, the garrisons of which
made frequent sorties, and cut off several of his foraging
parties. The Bishop of Durham was therefore
ordered to lay siege to these fortresses. His efforts,
however, were at first unsuccessful; he was
driven from the walls of Dirleton with considerable
loss; and as the force under his command was in want
of provisions, as well as of a sufficient battering train,
he sent Sir John Fitz-Marmaduke to represent his
situation at head-quarters. “Go back,” said Edward,
“and tell Antony that he is right to be pacific
when he is acting the Bishop, but that in his
present business he must forget his calling: and
as for you, Marmaduke,” addressing the messenger,
“You are a relentless soldier; I have often
had to reprove you for too cruel exultation over
the death of your enemies; but return now whence
you came, and be as relentless as you choose, you
will deserve my thanks, not my censure;&mdash;but
look you do not see my face again till these three
castles are razed to the <span class="locked">ground.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>While lying inactive in the preceptory of the
Templars, Edward appears to have amused himself,
by raising a number of young squires to the
rank of knighthood; and&mdash;a few ships, affording
a temporary supply, having very opportunely arrived&mdash;a
donation of wine was distributed on the occasion
among the soldiers, the effects of which liberality
soon became apparent. Intoxicated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
their allowance, the national animosity of the English
and Welsh troops broke out in a dangerous
mutiny. The latter, inflamed by wine, and irritated
by the privations they had already suffered,
attacked the English in their quarters during the
night, and murdered eighteen ecclesiastics; whereupon
the English cavalry, in revenge, rode in upon
the assailants, and slew eighty of their number.
The Welsh, who amounted to 40,000, now withdrew
from the English in high displeasure at the
slaughter of their countrymen; and Edward, having
at first made light of the affair, afterwards found
it necessary to exert himself, in order to effect a
reconciliation. Meantime, the scarcity continued
to increase in his camp to such an extent, as induced
him to issue his orders for a retreat.</p>

<p>The Scottish army, by the prudence of its leader,
had hitherto been kept as it were invisible from
the enemy, who were only aware of its existence,
by the desolation with which it surrounded
them; and the excellent generalship of Wallace
was now to all appearance about to be crowned
with its usual success, when his plans were rendered
abortive by the treachery of his pretended
adherents. Two Scottish <span class="locked">noblemen<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> found means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
to communicate to the Bishop of Durham the position
of the Scottish army, and their intention to
surprise the English by a night attack, and afterwards
to hang upon their rear, and harass them
in their retreat. Edward received this news with
ecstasy. “Thanks be to God!” he exclaimed,
“who hath hitherto extricated me from every danger.
They shall not need to follow me, since I
shall forthwith go and meet them;” and, instantly
countermanding the orders for a retreat, he prepared
to go in search of the Scottish army.</p>

<p>Though the utmost diligence was used by Edward
and his officers, morning was pretty far advanced
before the immense concourse of warriors
could be put in motion. The distant stations
which an army so numerous must necessarily have
occupied, rendered an instant removal altogether
impossible; and a whole summer’s day was therefore
consumed, in enabling them to reach an extensive
heath to the east of Linlithgow; where, for
that night, they rested in their armour. In the
mid-watch, however, an alarm spread, that the enemy
were at hand, and considerable confusion ensued.
It originated in an uproar, occasioned by
an accident which happened to the King:&mdash;His
war-horse, which stood beside him, had it seems
become restive, and trampled on him as he lay on
the heath; and his domestics having raised the cry,
that the King was wounded, every man grasped
his weapon, and stood on his defence. Philip de
Belvey, the King’s surgeon, however, soon quieted
their apprehensions, and they again betook themselves
to rest.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ENGLISH ARMY ADVANCE TO LINLITHGOW.&mdash;BATTLE OF
FALKIRK, FROM THE ACCOUNTS GIVEN BY ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH
WRITERS.&mdash;MISCELLANEOUS TRANSACTIONS.</span></h2>

<p>Day broke on the army of England moving onward
to Linlithgow in one long and variegated column.
To those whom sanctity of character, or
local situation, enabled to await its approach, the
spectacle, which was now at hand, must have been
fearfully interesting. Since the days of the Romans,
the present army was perhaps the largest
that had traversed the plains of Scotland. Many
alterations had been introduced about this time
into Europe by the crusaders; and Edward, who
was no inapt scholar in the military art, had, during
his residence in Palestine, and his expeditions
to France, availed himself of every invention that
came under his observation. His army, therefore,
might justly be considered as the most perfect in
discipline, equipment, and feudal splendour, that
Christendom could boast of at the time. As it
approached, it seemed to lengthen,&mdash;the interminable
array issuing, as it were, from some inexhaustible
source on the verge of the horizon: Its glittering
mazes occasionally appearing and disappearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
among the inequalities of the road, might be aptly
compared to the undulating movements of one of
those enormous serpents that figure in the pages
of romance, some of whose coils are at times seen
while its extremities are concealed amid the darkness
of the den from whence it is represented as issuing
forth. Most of the inhabitants fled before
the unwelcome intruders, except a few Carmelite
friars, who stopped to gaze on the warlike pageant.</p>

<p>The confused hum of this living mass increased
as it advanced, till the deserted walls of Linlithgow
resounded to the braying of clarions, the thundering
of kettle-drums, and the prancing of war-steeds in
flowing caparisons, bestrode by warriors mailed
to the teeth, having long two-handed swords depending
from their girdles, while their right hands
held lances, and their left supported triangular
shields painted with the various devices of their
families.</p>

<p>Henry de Lacy, Earl of <span class="locked">Lincoln,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> and Humphry
de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and Constable
of England, led the first division. The second
was under the charge of Bishop Bek, who, having
executed the commission Edward had sent him by
John Fitz-Marmaduke, next appeared in this portentous
march, attended by thirty-nine banners; for
this proud ecclesiastic spared no expense to render
his retinue as magnificent as possible. In the third
division under the command of the King, besides
the royal standard (<i>three leopards courant</i>), there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
waved, the sacred banner of St John of Beverley,
that of St George (<i>white with a red cross</i>), that
of St Edmond, King of the West-Saxons, (<i>blue
with three gold crowns</i>), that of St Edward the
Confessor, (<i>blue, with a cross fleury between five
martlets, gold</i>), and also the ominous standard of
Henry III., by the unfurling of which the army
were apprised of the vicinity of the enemy, and the
certainty of an approaching battle. This gorgeous
emblem of war was never displayed, except to announce
a positive intention to fight: it was formed
of red satin, bearing a dragon embroidered in
gold, having sapphire eyes, and the tongue ingeniously
contrived to seem continually <span class="locked">moving.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst those who followed the royal banner,
was Brian <span class="locked">Fitz-Alan,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> the late Governor of Scotland,
attended by his vassals, and those Scots who
still ventured to oppose the liberties of their country.
Of the latter, we find Brian le Jay, preceptor
of the Scottish Templars, who probably joined
Edward at Torphichen. What number of
knights accompanied him to the field in this formidable
crusade against the freedom of that people
who fostered them, cannot now be ascertained;
we may, however, venture to include <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">John de
Sautre, “Maister de la Chivalerie de Templi en
Ecosse.”</i></p>

<p>The immense multitude of Welsh collected by
Edward, as being better acquainted with mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
warfare, were dispersed among the different divisions
of the forces. Being mostly archers, and
clothed in white tunics, they were easily distinguished
from the other troops.</p>

<p>Tradition asserts, that this grand army took a
whole day to deploy through the town of Linlithgow.
This perhaps may be true respecting the
parties escorting the heavy war-engines, suttlers
attending the camp, and other stragglers; but the
advanced guard of the English came in sight of
the Scottish outposts early in the day. The latter
occupied the ridge of a hill; and as the English
marched up to attack them, a thick mist intervened,
and prevented the intended rencounter.</p>

<p>When the day cleared up, the Scottish army
was discovered in the distance, taking up their positions,
and preparing for battle. Their numbers
did not exceed 30,000&mdash;not a third part of the
force opposed to them; and aware of the immense
advantages which Edward possessed, and
extremely averse to risk the safety of the country
on the issue of a single battle, the Guardian would
gladly have protracted the warfare, by retiring farther
to the north. Divisions, however, prevailed
among the leaders of the Scots; and, before they
could agree on the measures necessary to be adopted,
the near approach of the English, and the
great superiority of the latter in cavalry, rendered
retreat extremely hazardous.</p>

<p>The Scottish army, which consisted principally
of spearmen or lancers, was arranged in four divisions
or schiltrons. Those in the centre held
their long spears perpendicular, and stood ready
to fill up a vacancy, while each intervening rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
gradually sloped their weapons till they came to a
level. The front rank kneeling, and the whole
closely wedged together, presented to the enemy
the appearance of four enormous, impenetrable porcupines,
the space between each being filled up
with archers.</p>

<p>Edward, on seeing these dispositions for battle,
hesitated to give orders for the attack, and proposed
that his followers should pitch their tents,
and allow the soldiers and horses time for rest and
refreshment. This was opposed by his officers, as
being unsafe in their present situation,&mdash;a small
rivulet only intervening between the two armies.
“What, then, would you advise?” exclaimed
Edward. “An immediate advance!” was the
reply; “the field and the victory will be our’s.”&mdash;“In
God’s name, then, let it be so!” said the
King.</p>

<p>The Earls of Lincoln and Hereford, accordingly,
led the first squadron to the attack. Their progress,
however, was retarded by an extensive morass,
which covered the front of the Scots, and
obliged their enemies to make a circuit to the
west. While thus employed, the powerful squadron
under the Bishop of Durham managed to
get in front of the enemy. Bek, however, on observing
the formidable appearance of his opponents,
wished to delay the charge till supported
by the column under the command of the King.
“Stick to thy mass, Bishop,” said Ralf Basset of
Drayton, “and teach us not what to do in the
face of an enemy.”&mdash;“On, then,” said Bek,
“Set on, in your own way; we are all soldiers
to-day, and bound to do our duty.” Instantly
they rushed forward, and soon became engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
with the first schiltron, which was almost simultaneously
attacked on the opposite quarter by the
first division which had cleared the morass. The
cavalry of the Scots, and a large body of the vassals
of John Cumyn, immediately wheeled about,
and left the field without awaiting the attack. The
schiltrons of spearmen, however, stood firm, and
repulsed all the efforts of their numerous and
heavy-armed assailants, who recoiled again and
again from before the mass of spears which their
enemies presented. Baffled in their attack, the
cavalry of Edward charged upon the archers,
who, less able to stand their ground against the
weight of their mail-clad adversaries, gave way.
In the confusion, Sir John Stewart of Bonkill,
brother to the Steward of Scotland, was thrown
to the ground, while attempting to rally his vassals,
the archers of Selkirk; and though many of
them rushed forward to his assistance, their exertions
were in vain:&mdash;their gallant leader fell, surrounded
by the bodies of his faithful tenantry.</p>

<p>Though heavy squadrons of cavalry were continually
pushed forward against the Scottish spearmen,
still the latter maintained their ranks, and
displayed such admirable discipline and stubborn
resolution, that Edward, convinced of the inability
of breaking their array, suspended the charges of
his horsemen, and ordered all his archers and
slingers to <span class="locked">advance.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span></p>

<p>The formation of these Scottish schiltrons was
admirably adapted for defence; and had they been
supplied with a sufficient body of cavalry to have
protected them from the assaults of the archers,
they might have kept their ground, in defiance of
every effort of the enemy. But, deserted by their
own cavalry, they now stood helplessly exposed
to a storm of missiles which assailed them in all
directions; for though those in the centre bravely
pressed forward to fill up the chasms in front,
cloud after cloud of arrows, mingled with stones,
continued to descend among their ranks with
increasing and deadly effect, till the ground was
encumbered around them; while their former
assailants sat with their horses on the rein, ready
to burst in upon them at the first opening that
would offer. The Scots at last became unsteady,
under the incessant and murderous discharge of
the English artillery. The cavalry then dashed
forward, and breaking in upon their ranks, completed
the confusion.</p>

<p>Wallace now saw that retreat was the only expedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
left by which he could save the remnant
of his countrymen; and having, with incredible
efforts, rallied a number of his most determined
adherents, he attacked the foremost of the pursuers,
and by that means covered the retreat of
the fugitives. Amongst the slain, Brian le <span class="locked">Jay<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> is
particularly mentioned. The death of this Templar,
which took place in Callender wood, damped
the ardour of his companions, and enabled the
Scots to make good their retreat. In this sanguinary
conflict, 15,000 Scots are said to have been
left on the field; the most distinguished of whom
were Sir John Graham of Dundalk, Sir John Stewart
of Bonkill, and MacDuff, grand-uncle to the
Earl of Fife. The extent of the English loss,
from the stubborn opposition of their enemies,
must also have been considerable. After the battle,
Wallace fell back on Stirling, which he burnt, in
order to prevent it from falling into the hands of
the English.</p>

<p>Respecting this battle, Scottish authors give a
very different account from the preceding, which
is chiefly taken from the pages of English historians.
According to the former, the envy of the
nobles towards Wallace, and the dissensions incident
thereto, were the chief, if not the sole occasion
of the disaster. The Scottish army, say they,
consisted of three divisions of ten thousand men
each, under the command of Sir John Cumyn,
Lord of Badenoch, chief of the powerful clan of
that name; Sir John Stewart, brother to the Lord
of Bute, who, in addition to his own tenantry,
headed those of his absent brother; and Sir William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Wallace,&mdash;three of the most powerful men in
the country, the two former from their birth and
influence, the latter from the great fame acquired
by his military achievements. On the brink of
the engagement, an imprudent and unfortunate
disagreement arose among the leaders. Stewart
insisted upon taking command of the army, being,
as he conceived, entitled to that honour, as the representative
of his brother, who was Lord High
Steward of Scotland; Cumyn claiming it, in his
own right, on account of high birth, and near relationship
to the crown; and Wallace, as Guardian
of the kingdom, refused to admit the pretensions of
either to a command which he, as representative of
their absent sovereign, conceived himself every way
entitled to, even though he had not earned that honour
by former services. Stewart, in the heat of
the altercation, is said to have upbraided Wallace
with the lowness of his birth, and charged him with
encroaching on the rights of the nobility, which
reminded him, he said, “of the owl in the fable,
who, having borrowed a feather from one bird,
and a feather from another, became vain of his
plumage, and endeavoured to lord it over his betters.
The application is not difficult,” continued
he; “for, if every nobleman in Scotland were to
claim his part of those vassals which now follow
your banners, your own personal retainers would
make but a sorry appearance in support of your
high-flown pretensions.” Wallace heard, with
stern composure, those ill-timed remarks of the
haughty chieftain. “I am not ignorant,” said
he, “of the source whence this insulting language
has proceeded; and since you, my Lord,
condescend to utter their sentiments, you may
be also induced to imitate their example: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
even this,” glancing a look of indignation at
Cumyn, “I am not altogether unprepared for.
Your fable of the owl is not quite applicable; for
I always showed myself in the face of day, asserting
the liberty and independence of my country,
while some others, like owls, courted concealment,
and were too much afraid of losing their
<i>roosts</i>, to leave them for such a cause. As to
my followers, I wish no man to follow me who is
not sound at the heart in the cause of his country;
and either at the head or in the ranks of these, I
will always consider it my glory to be found. In
the mean time, till it appear who are entitled to
that character, I will make an alteration in my
position.” Having thus spoken, he removed those
under his command to a strong position on the
face of a hill immediately behind.</p>

<p>Edward, as if aware of the feud that thus existed
in the Scottish camp, and though suffering from
the effects of his late accident, ordered the Earl
of Hereford, Constable of England, to advance
with a body of thirty thousand men, to attack the
division under Cumyn; who, on seeing them approach,
turned his banners, and marched off the
field, leaving Stewart and his Brandanes (as the
inhabitants of Bute were then called), and the
archers of Selkirk, his immediate vassals, exposed
to all the fury of the charge. They sustained it
with the firmest resolution; but the great mass
of assailants against whom they were engaged,
left them little chance of success. Stewart, in
the early part of the battle, while giving orders
to a body of archers, was thrown from his horse
and slain. His followers, however, far from being
discouraged by the loss of their chief, continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the conflict with the greatest bravery. Macduff,
with a great part of his retainers, were cut off,
in their endeavours to retrieve the fortunes of
the day, yet numbers forced their way through
the ranks of the English, and joined the division
under Wallace. This was observed by Edward,
who, impatient at the resistance he had already
met with, ordered Robert Bruce and the
Bishop of Durham to advance with the forces
under their command. While Wallace was engaged
in securing the retreat of his unfortunate
countrymen, Bruce made a circuit round the hill
which he occupied, and gaining the ascent, obliged
him to quit his position, and endeavour to
force his way through the enemy beneath. The
charge of this fresh body of Scots, composed of
the stoutest and best disciplined warriors in the
country, was but ill sustained by the division
they attacked, which, giving way before their impetuous
descent, was thrown into confusion; and
Wallace, availing himself of their disorder, directed
his troops to cross the Carron, and occupy a
post which commanded the ford. In the meantime,
with a small but choice body of his friends,
he kept in the rear, and continued to charge and
repulse those that were most forward in the pursuit.
In one of these efforts, Wallace advanced
alone from the midst of his little band, and, with
a single blow, slew Sir Brian le Jay, a knight
<span class="locked">templar<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> of high military renown, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
shown himself most active in harassing the retreating
Scots. This action rendered the others
more cautious in their approaches. Sir John
Graham, however, giving way to a gallant but imprudent
ardour, advanced too far amongst the enemy,
where he was surrounded and slain; and
Wallace, after repeated endeavours to revenge the
death of his friend, rejoined his followers. This
he effected with great difficulty, from the influx of
the tide, and the weakness of his horse, which is
said to have been so worn out with the fatigues of
the day, and the wounds it had received, that the
noble animal expired as soon as it had placed its
master beyond the reach of his pursuers. By the
attention of his trusty follower Kerlé, who stood
an anxious spectator on the danger of his chief,
Wallace was furnished with a fresh horse; and
the two friends, as they moved slowly along the
banks of the river, were gazing with silent and
sorrowful interest on the scene of carnage they had
left, when Bruce, from the opposite bank, having
recognised the Guardian, raised his voice, and requested
an interview. This was readily granted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
and the warriors approached each other from
opposite sides of the river, at a place narrow,
deep and rocky. When on the margin of the
stream, Wallace waved his hand, to repress the
curiosity of his followers, while he eyed his misled
countryman with stern, but dignified composure.
Bruce felt awed by the majestic appearance
and deportment of the patriot, and his voice,
though loud, became tremulous as he thus addressed
him:&mdash;“I am surprised, Sir William, that
you should entertain thoughts, as it is believed you
do, of attaining to the crown of Scotland; and
that, with this chimerical object in view, you
should thus continue to expose yourself to so many
dangers. It is not easy, you find, to resist the
King of England, who is one of the greatest princes
in the world. And were you even successful
in your attempts, are you so vain as to imagine,
that the Scots will ever suffer you to be their
King?” The Guardian did not allow him to say
more. “No,” replied he, “my thoughts never
soared so high, nor do I intend to usurp a crown
I very well know my birth can give me no right
to, and my services can never merit. I only mean
to deliver my country from oppression and slavery,
and to support a just cause, which you have abandoned.
You, my lord, whose right may entitle
you to be King, ought to protect the kingdom;
’tis because you do it not, that I must, and will,
while I breathe, endeavour the defence of that
country I was born to serve, and for which, if Providence
will have it so, to die. As for you, who, in
place of exerting your talents to turn the tide of
battle in your country’s favour, choose rather to
live a slave, if with safety to your life and fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
than free, with the hazard of losing the latter,
you may remain in possession of what you so
much value, while the hollow praises of our enemies
may blind you to the enormity of your conduct;
but remember, my lord, they whom you
are thus aiding to bind the yoke of slavery on the
necks of your countrymen, will not long consider
that conduct praise-worthy in you, which they
would condemn as infamous in themselves; and if
they are successful in rivetting our chains, you will
find your reward in the well-earned contempt of
the oppressor, and the hearty execrations of the
oppressed. Pause, therefore, and reflect; if you
have but the heart to claim the crown, you
may win it with glory, and wear it with justice.
I can do neither; but what I can I will&mdash;live
and die a free born man.” These generous
sentiments, uttered in a clear, manly, and determined
tone of voice, came home to the heart of
Bruce, with all the sternness of deserved reproof;
and he was about to reply, when the ringing of
harness, followed by the appearance of a number
of helmets, over-topping the ridge of a neighbouring
hillock, made it prudent to break off the conference.</p>

<p>Such are the particulars of this memorable battle,
as related, with some trifling variations, by most
of, if not by all, our old Scottish historians. As
modern commentators, however, consider themselves
justified in denying some of the material
points; particularly the feud among the leaders&mdash;the
presence of Bruce in the engagement&mdash;and,
consequently, his conference with Wallace, we shall
in this place devote a few pages to their consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
These objections are chiefly founded on the
authority of Hemingford and Trevit, two English
monks, who are said to have had their information
from eye-witnesses. This may be all true; but when
we find one of them (Hemingford) asserting, that
“<i>fifty thousand Scots were slain in the battle, many
drowned, three hundred thousand foot taken
prisoners, besides a thousand horse</i>,” we may reasonably
suppose the possibility of the <i>eye-witnesses</i>
being so much occupied in counting their
killed and captured enemies, that matters of such
comparatively trifling importance may not have
had the requisite share of their attention. Lord
Hailes, however, lends the weight of his highly
respectable name in support of those who deny the
truth of this portion of our national annals, and
thus expresses himself on the points in question:
“It would be tedious and unprofitable to recite
all that has been said on this subject by our own
writers, from Fordun to Abercrombie, how Wallace,
Stewart, and Comyn quarrelled on the punctilio
of leading the van of an army, which stood
on the defensive; how Stewart compared Wallace
to an owl, with borrowed feathers; how the Scottish
leaders, busied in this frivolous altercation,
had no leisure to form their army; how Comyn
traitorously withdrew with ten thousand men;
how Wallace, from resentment, followed his example;
how, by such disastrous incidents, the
Scottish army was enfeebled, and Stewart and his
party abandoned to destruction. Our histories abound
in trash of this kind. There is scarcely
one of our writers who has not produced an invective
against Comyn, or an apology for Wallace,
or a lamentation for the deserted Stewart. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
dissensions may have prevailed among the Scottish
commanders, it is impossible to know. It appears
not to me, that their dissensions had any influence
on their conduct in the day of battle. The truth
seems to be this:&mdash;The English cavalry greatly exceeded
the Scotch in numbers&mdash;were infinitely better
equipped, and more adroit. The Scottish cavalry
were intimidated and fled:&mdash;Had they remained
in the field, they might have preserved
their honour, but never could have turned the
chance of that day. It was natural, however, for
such of their party as survived the engagement,
to impute the disaster to the defection of the cavalry:&mdash;National
pride would ascribe their flight to
treachery rather than to pusillanimity. It is not
improbable, that Comyn commanded the cavalry;
hence a report may have spread, that Comyn betrayed
his country: the report has been embellished
by each successive relation. When men are
seized with a panic, their commander <i>must</i> of necessity,
or <i>will</i> from prudence, accompany them
in their flight. Earl Warren fled with his army
from Stirling to Berwick, yet Edward did not punish
him as a traitor or a coward.</p>

<p>“The tale of Comyn’s treachery and Wallace’s
ill-timed resentment, may have gained credit, because
it is a pretty tale, and not improbable in itself;
but it always amazes me that the story of
the <i>congress</i> of Bruce and Wallace, after the battle
of Falkirk, should have gained credit. I lay
aside the full evidence which we now possess, ‘that
Bruce was not at that time of the English party,
nor present at the battle’&mdash;for it must be admitted,
that our historians knew nothing of those circumstances
which demonstrate the impossibility of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
<i>congress</i>&mdash;but the wonder is, that men of sound
judgment should not have seen the absurdity of a
long conversation between the commander of a flying
army, and one of the leaders of a victorious
army. When Fordun told the story, he placed
‘a narrow but inaccessible glen’ between the speakers.
Later historians have substituted the river Carron,
in place of an inaccessible glen; and they make
Bruce and Wallace talk across the river like two
young declaimers from the pulpits in a school of
rhetoric.”</p>

<p>With all due deference to his Lordship, we conceive
that the strength of his first objection lies
chiefly in adhering too literally to the words “<i>leading
the van</i>,” made use of by some of our old
writers; others, who mention the quarrel, do not so
express themselves. Now, we do not see any
thing so improbable in a discussion arising among
these chiefs, who considered themselves independent
of each other, about who should have the supreme
command in directing the operations of the
day, which, we presume, is all that is to be understood
in this instance by “<i>leading the van</i>.” The
obvious advantage of having a commander-in-chief
in so momentous an occasion, could not have
escaped the merest tyro in military tactics; and
that no person was appointed to this office, even
his Lordship does not deny. That Wallace, from
past services, as well as from being Guardian of the
kingdom, had reason to consider himself entitled to
this distinction, cannot be disputed; and it is not
likely, from the talents and foresight he had displayed
on former occasions, that he would have
come to the field against so powerful and so experienced
an adversary, without having previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
formed some plan for conducting the operations of
the day, so as to counteract the great superiority
of force, which the English monarch had brought
into the field. The thwarting of his plans, by the
envy and hauteur of his colleagues, affords a plain
and obvious solution of his conduct; and his resignation
of the Guardianship after the battle,
(which his Lordship does not deny,) very strongly
corroborates the account given by our Scottish historians,
of the treatment which he received on the
field; and this treatment must have been attended
with circumstances which convinced him of the
utter hopelessness of his being able to direct the
resources of the country to advantage. Strong
indeed must have been the reasons which induced
this brave, intrepid, and prudent pilot, to relinquish
the helm of affairs at so critical a juncture. That
an unfortunate animosity existed, we have the
most ample testimony; and though his Lordship
conceives it to have been so very trifling in its nature,
as not to influence the parties in the discharge
of their duty, yet we have respectable and
incontrovertible evidence that it not only did so,
but was the principal, if not the sole cause of the
disasters which overwhelmed the country. Wyntown
thus expresses himself, on the occasion:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“For dyspyt and gret inwy<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Here there is no national pride interfering, to
conceal the extent of the discomfiture of the Scots;
and it is surprising his Lordship should conceive, that
any one would think it necessary to invent what
he calls a “<i>pretty tale</i>,” for the purpose of soothing
the national feelings. Thirty thousand Scots,
we presume, may be defeated by ninety or a hundred
thousand English, without being <i>very</i> much
disgraced by the affair; whereas the English authorities
may have been silent on circumstances
which tended to diminish the glory of their victory,
even had they come to their knowledge.</p>

<p>That Cumyn commanded the cavalry is merely
a conjecture of his Lordship; but allowing it to
have been the case, we conceive there is a material
difference between a leader joining in the general
flight of his army, and one riding off with
part of the forces, and leaving the rest to stand
the brunt of the engagement. If Warren had
acted so, we presume he would either have been
punished as a traitor, or cashiered as a coward.
That Cumyn was afterwards elected one of the regents
of the kingdom, affords no satisfactory evidence
of his having acted correctly. He was at
the head of the only entire body of troops in the
country, and his faction unbroken&mdash;of course, there
could be no opposition to his election. And the
wonder is, considering the ambition of the man, that
under these circumstances he was not appointed
sole regent, in place of sharing a divided authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
as will be seen in the sequel, with one who was
his inferior in birth, talents, and influence.</p>

<p>We cannot see any great improbability of the
“<i>congress</i>” (as his Lordship calls it) having taken
place in the manner described, provided that
<i>Bruce was present</i>. Wallace had already secured
his troops from immediate pursuit. Bruce might
think it a favourable opportunity to palliate his conduct
at Irvine; and Wallace, who was seldom
afraid to come in juxtaposition with any one,
might have been easily induced to stand when he
hailed him. His Lordship’s objection is founded
chiefly on the length of the conversation. Now, if
any one will peruse it, even in the most verbose of
our historians, he will find that it could not have
occupied more than five minutes, which certainly
cannot be called “a long conversation,” or at least
so long as to afford any thing like a plausible objection
to its occurrence. As to Fordun having placed
“a narrow inaccessible glen” between the parties, it
does not in the least affect the credibility of the
account. Few glens are to be found in Scotland,
without a river or stream of some description running
through them; and in speaking of any of these,
it is no uncommon thing for one person to allude
to the glen, and another to the river or stream so
connected with it.</p>

<p>That all our ancient authors should agree in the
circumstance of Bruce being present at the battle,
is very singular, provided he was not there. How
they should all be in this state of ignorance is rather
unaccountable, considering the facility they
had of informing themselves; as some of them must
have written from authority, if not of eye-witnesses,
at least of those who derived their accounts from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
such. It is not at all probable that Bruce, who is
universally acknowledged to have been a monarch
of great political sagacity, would have allowed a
tale, so likely to injure him in the opinion of his
subjects, to get into general circulation, while the
contrary statement, <i>if true</i>, would have tended to
exalt him in their estimation. There appear so
many irreconcilable circumstances involved in the
belief of this opinion, that we feel much inclined
to suspect some little discrepancy in the evidence
to which his Lordship so confidently <span class="locked">alludes,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
particularly as Wyntowne, whose authority is highly
appreciated by all writers, is so very pointed in
asserting the presence of Bruce in the English army.
The words are,</p>

<p class="in0">Here our author, not satisfied with stating, that
“Robert de Brows” was with “<i>King Edwart</i>;”
but, in order to establish the identity of the person,
and guard against his being confounded with
the elder Robert Bruce, or any other of the same

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i>Set he oure Kyng wes eftyrwart.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>If Bruce was at this time on the side of the
patriots, as his Lordship says, it is singular that
he did not appear among them on this eventful day,
in a manner becoming his birth, talents, and great
territorial influence. When all the chiefs of the party
had collected their followers for a grand national
struggle, Bruce is represented as employed in
guarding, what his Lordship, for the sake of <i>effect</i>,
calls the “important castle of Ayr,” which, it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
in those days, “<i>kept the communication open with
Galloway, Argyllshire, and the Isles</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Had the
possession of this “important castle” been of any
use to an army stationed between Linlithgow and
Falkirk, it certainly could have been defended by
a person of less consequence than Bruce, whose
military talents and numerous vassals would have
been of infinitely greater service in the field. When
Wallace was straining every nerve to collect the
strength of the country, to oppose the formidable
invaders, and with his utmost efforts could not
muster more than 30,000 soldiers, can it be supposed,
that he would have failed to summon to
the standard of liberty a baron of such influence
as the Earl of Carrick, if he thought there were a
chance of the summons being obeyed?</p>

<p>Though his Lordship asserts that Bruce had
deserted the cause of Edward, yet he does not attempt
to show that any communication took place
between him and the Scottish army; nor by what
authority he assumed the defence of the castle of
Ayr, which was a fortress at that time belonging
to the Crown. If Hemingford, on whose authority
his Lordship chiefly relies, could have gone
so egregiously astray from every thing like probability
in the account he gives of the casualties of
the battle, we may, without injustice, receive his
testimony on this, or on any other subject, with suspicion;
particularly when it goes to contradict
historians of acknowledged veracity, who had opportunities
of being at least equally well informed
on the subject as himself. It has been advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
by the learned annalist, in evidence of the truth
of Hemingford’s statement, that lands and castles
belonging to Bruce were plundered and taken
by the English army. By a parity of reasoning,
if these lands and castles had been exempt
from the general outrage, it would have proved
that Bruce was in the interest of England; and
the Guardian and Barons of Scotland would thereby
have stood convicted of the unparalleled folly
of allowing lands to be occupied, and castles to be
held, in the very centre of the country, by the
open and declared partisan of their enemy. That
the title of Bruce to his Scottish estates was in
abeyance, and his castles garrisoned for the safety
of the commonwealth of Scotland, is the most
probable state of the affair. When the half-famished
soldiers of Edward, therefore, pillaged the
lands, and attacked the castles of Bruce, they did
what their King, under such circumstances, neither
could nor would restrain, whether his vassal
had renounced his allegiance or not. This conduct
on the part of the English, therefore, can afford
no evidence whatever of Bruce being at the
time “in arms against England.”</p>

<p>These observations the writer has thought it
expedient to make, in support of the relation
given of the battle of Falkirk by the ancient historians
of Scotland. As the talents, however, which
Lord Hailes has displayed in his researches into
Scottish history, are held by the public in high,
and in many instances, deserved estimation; and
though it is with reluctance that we differ from one
whose opinions in general are entitled to credit;
yet, as we find him in this instance at variance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
with most of our ancient Scottish authorities, we
have thought it our duty to endeavour to lay both
sides of the question fairly before the reader, in
order that he may be able to form his own opinion
of the matter.</p>

<span class="subhead">NOTICES RESPECTING SIR JOHN GRAHAM AND SIR JOHN STEWART.&mdash;CONDUCT
OF CUMYN.&mdash;WALLACE RESIGNS THE GUARDIANSHIP.&mdash;EDWARD
RETURNS HOME.&mdash;TRIUMPHANT PROCESSION
OF THE LONDONERS IN HONOUR OF HIS VICTORY AT FALKIRK.&mdash;REVIEW
OF THE CAMPAIGN.</span></h2>

<p>The retreat of Wallace from the field of Falkirk,
may justly be considered as a masterpiece of generalship.
The formidable bodies of horse at the
disposal of Edward, afforded him ample means of
following up and cutting off the retiring army of
the Guardian. That so large a body of the Scots,
though deserted by their own cavalry, should however
have effected their escape in presence of a
force so powerful, so well appointed, and headed
by one of the first generals of the age, is truly
astonishing; and can only be accounted for by
supposing, either that the English must have suffered
severely in the action, or that the conduct
displayed by Wallace was such as awed them from
the attempt.</p>

<p>According to the Minstrel, the Guardian, after
withdrawing his troops to a place of safety, returned
to the field, accompanied by Malcolm Earl
of Lennox, Ramsay of Auchterhouse, Sir Richard
Lundin, Wallace of Riccarton, Sir Crytell <span class="locked">Seton,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
and a number of their followers, to seek for
the body of Sir John Graham&mdash;the English being
by this time removed to Linlithgow.</p>

<p>Considering the great affection our hero entertained
for this gallant and accomplished warrior,
the circumstance is not improbable. The high
value he placed on his services was such, that,
in speaking of Graham, he used to designate him
as his “right hand.” The regret which he felt at
his death, would no doubt have been embittered
by the reflection, that his friend might easily, from
the state of the wounds which he had received at
the affair of Blackironside, have absented himself
from the battle of Falkirk, without the slightest
injury to his reputation. The distress of Wallace,
on seeing the dead body, is thus finely depicted
by the forementioned <span class="locked">author:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<p>In this monody, we have a highly finished portrait
of a warrior and a gentleman; and the assemblage
of rare and shining virtues which are
thus said to have met in this illustrious individual,
have never been denied or depreciated by the
most fastidious of our critics; while all our historians
bear uniform testimony to the correctness of
the <span class="locked">character.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> Having discharged this duty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
his departed friend, Wallace rejoined his followers
in the Torwood; and, on the following night, he
is said to have broken into the English camp on
Linlithgow muir, and, after killing a number of
the enemy, and spreading alarm through the whole
army, effected his retreat without loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Edward, incensed at the frequency with which
these night attacks were repeated, now determined
on pursuing the Scots with his whole forces. His
nimble adversaries, however, retired before him,
and, having burned Stirling, continued to waste the
country as they went along; so that the enemy
was put to the greatest inconvenience, from the
want of forage for his numerous cavalry.</p>

<p>While the Guardian and his little army of patriots
were thus engaging the attention of the invader,
Cumyn and the partisans of Stewart were
loud in their expressions of disapprobation at the
conduct of our hero. The latter charged him with
the loss of the battle, by his refraining to assist
Stewart till it was too late; and the former, conscious
of his own misconduct, in order to supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
something like a pretext for having treacherously
deserted his countrymen, accused the Guardian
with an intention of usurping the sovereign authority;
declaring, “that it was more honourable
for men of birth to serve a great and powerful
monarch, though a foreigner, than subject themselves
to the tyranny of an upstart of yesterday.”</p>

<p>While such sentiments were circulating among
the adherents of these two powerful families, to the
manifest injury of the cause of liberty, Cumyn was
still increasing the number of his followers; and it
appeared uncertain, whether he intended to assist
his countrymen, or take part with the invader.
Wallace now saw, that, without involving the kingdom
in all the horrors of civil war, he could not exercise
his authority so as to compel this factious
chief to the discharge of his duty; and as the views
of Cumyn with regard to the crown, had, on many
occasions, been too palpably displayed, to have
escaped the observation of Wallace, his late unaccountable
retreat had completely opened the eyes of
the Guardian to the line of policy he was pursuing.
Indeed, had both divisions of the Scottish army been
destroyed, Cumyn would have found little difficulty
in obtaining the crown from Edward, on the same
terms as it had been awarded to Baliol: for being at
the head of a powerful body of men, with great family
interest, and having already made a favourable
impression on the English king, by his conduct at
the battle of Falkirk, it is highly probable that any
lingering partiality which Edward might still entertain
for Bruce&mdash;whom he had long amused with
hopes of the crown&mdash;would soon disappear before
the pretensions of a more useful claimant. But
as Cumyn made the ambition of Wallace the pretext<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
for his refraining to co-operate against the English,
with a promptitude which showed his mind
as decisive as his sword, when the interest of his
country was at stake, the latter called the Estates
together, and solemnly renounced the Guardianship
of the kingdom, reserving to himself no other privilege
than that of fighting against the enemies of Scotland,
at the head of such friends as might be inclined
to adhere to him. This resignation was accordingly
followed by the election of a Regency,
consisting of Cumyn, Soulis, and William Lamberton,
Bishop of St <span class="locked">Andrews;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> and by this conduct
on the part of Wallace, Cumyn was left without
the shadow of an excuse for withholding his
assistance against the common enemy; while the
talents, prowess, and patriotism of the late Guardian
acted as a check in restraining him from sacrificing
the interest of the country to his own
personal aggrandizement.</p>

<p>Edward reached Stirling four days after the late
battle, and took up his quarters in the convent of
the Dominicans. Here he remained fifteen days,
waiting his recovery from the wound inflicted on
him by his horse, and for the arrival of his long-expected
fleet. The Castle of Stirling having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
partly demolished by Wallace, in his retreat, Edward
now applied himself to repair it; and therein,
as a place of safety, he deposited those unwieldy
engines of war he had brought with him
for the purpose of battering the fortifications, and
which he found would be troublesome, while pursuing
his enemies over the rugged and mountainous
country that lay before him.</p>

<p>The accession of strength which the cause of
liberty acquired, by the prudent measures of our
patriot, enabled the Scots more effectually to embarrass
the movements of the enemy. While he,
with his brave followers, continued to surprise
the foe, by breaking into their camp where least
expected, the other leaders were engaged in preventing
supplies from reaching the English; and
Edward, at last, became apprehensive of advancing
too far into the sterile regions of the North.
A scarcity had already begun to be severely felt in
his army, and he now prudently directed his march
towards the more fruitful districts in the neighbourhood
of Perth. But there also his unwearied
and restless enemy continued to assail those parts
of the army that appeared most vulnerable; and
having at last cut off a part from the main
body of the English forces, by breaking down the
bridge over the Tay, in three successive engagements
he defeated them with great slaughter. The
English army, however, was still too numerous for
the Scots to risk a general engagement; and Edward,
finding no probability of bringing the war
to a satisfactory conclusion, after wreaking his vengeance
on the most fruitful parts of the country, returned
home through Ayrshire and Annandale, carrying
with him all the spoil he could collect. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
body of troops under the command of Henry de
Lacy, made a similar inroad in Fife, destroying
whatever came in their way, in revenge, no doubt,
for the gallant stand the inhabitants had made under
MacDuff, their late unfortunate chief. After
destroying St <span class="locked">Andrew’s,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> he laid siege to the castle
of Cupar, which surrendered about the end of
<span class="locked">July.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span></p>

<p>Edward now led his army homewards, after
leaving a force to protect the southern part of
Scotland, the reduction of which was all his mighty
efforts had been able to accomplish. To have defeated
Wallace, however, a name which had filled
England with dismay, was considered by his subjects
an achievement deserving of the highest eulogium.
The disasters of the campaign were accordingly
forgotten, and bands of minstrels issued from
the different towns on his route, to welcome the conqueror
at Falkirk. The Londoners decreed him a
triumphal procession in honour of his victory, and
the different corporations vied with each other in
the richness of their banners and the splendour of
their emblematical representations. Stowe thus
mentions the affair; and if we may judge of the appearance
of the other professions by the display<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
made by the fishmongers on this joyous occasion,
the whole must have exhibited a mass of barbaric
magnificence not easily to be surpassed:&mdash;“The
citizens of London hearing of the great victory
obtained by the King of England against the Scottis,
made great and solemn rejoicings in their citie,
every one according to their craft, especially
the fishmongers, which with solemn procession
passed through the citie, having, amongst other
pageantes and shows, foure sturgeons gilted, carried
on four horses, then four salmons of silver
on four horses, and after five and fortie knights
armed, riding on horses made like luces of the
sea, and then Saint Magnus with a thousand horsemen.
This they did on St Magnus’ day, in honour
of the King’s great victory and safe return.”</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter, it may not be amiss to
take a retrospect view of this most interesting campaign.
At the commencement of it, Scotland, by
the wisdom and energy of her intrepid Guardian,
had again taken her place among the independent
nations of Europe. His noble achievements had
not only become a theme for the Troubadours of
France, but also the subject of conversation and
applause at all the courts on the Continent. To
Edward, who had not only distinguished himself
by his warlike exploits in Syria, but had also, in a
tournament held at Calais, baffled and disgraced
the most renowned of the chivalry of France, the
plaudits bestowed upon a rival so far beneath him
in rank, was peculiarly mortifying, and excited in
him the most inveterate hostility toward the nation
thus rescued from his thraldom. Wallace,
though making every effort for the safety of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
country, found no abatement of that feeling of
jealous animosity which existed in the minds of
a great majority of the aristocracy. It was in vain
he endeavoured to ensure their confidence, by refusing
all participation in the fruits of their victories,&mdash;thus
shewing that <i>self-aggrandisement</i> formed
none of the objects of his ambition. Still they
yielded with reluctance that obedience which his
rank as Guardian entitled him to expect; and their
language in private continued to be, “We will
not have this man to reign over us.”</p>

<p>Cumyn, whose conduct had hitherto been suspicious,
had strengthened his interest at the English
court, by means of a marriage which he
contracted with the sister of Adomer de <span class="locked">Vallance,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span>
a cousin, and one of the principal favourites of Edward;
and the Steward, brother to the knight of
Bonkill, had made his peace with the invader, and
taken the oath of allegiance. In consequence of
which, according to the policy of the English monarch,
though the tenantry of the Steward were arrayed
against him, yet the banners of the family
floated among those of the other vassals of the English
crown, while the knight of Bonkill himself (who
had but recently joined the standard of his country’s
independence) had as yet given no proof of
the sincerity of his attachment to the cause. Under
these circumstances, it became Wallace to be
particularly circumspect in his movements, having
to guard against the chance of treachery on the
one hand, and a powerful adversary on the other;
while his country’s safety, and his own well-earned
laurels, depended alike on the prudence of his conduct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
We have already hinted at the great improbability
of his appearing before so formidable an
enemy, without having formed a regular plan of operation,
and made provision for the contingencies that
might occur. That he had arranged such a plan,
and was prevented, by the jealousy of his colleagues,
from putting it into execution, appears sufficiently
obvious, even from the meagre details of which we
are possessed. What this plan was, cannot now be
fully ascertained; but if we may judge from the
circumstances on record, we may infer that it was
not his intention to risk a general engagement with
the enemy at Falkirk, but merely to retire as they
advanced, and to lead them as far as possible into
the barren districts of the North, where their numerous
cavalry would be rendered in a great measure
unavailing. But the conduct of Cumyn, and
the profitless display of valour on the part of
Stewart, brought him unavoidably into contact with
the enemy; respect for his own reputation prevented
him from retiring, while part of his countrymen
were so seriously engaged; and by remaining, he
not only covered the retreat of the remains of
Stewart’s division, but also, by his commanding attitude,
prevented the enemy from pursuing the fugitives
with that destructive celerity which their
numerous cavalry would have enabled them to do,
had he acted otherwise. We have been induced to
make these remarks, as Wallace is too rashly blamed
for “remaining a passive spectator of the destruction
of Stewart.” This, according to the generality
of writers, is the only stain upon his character.
However, from a careful review of all the circumstances
of the case, we can find no foundation
whatever for the charge; on the contrary, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
into consideration the peculiarly embarrassing situation
in which he was placed, we conceive that,
during the whole of his brilliant career, the wisdom,
talents, and patriotism of Wallace, never shone
forth with more resplendent lustre than at the
battle of Falkirk.</p>

RAISES AN ARMY FOR ITS RELIEF.&mdash;THE ENGLISH BARONS
REFUSE TO ACCOMPANY HIM.&mdash;SURRENDER OF STIRLING
CASTLE.&mdash;CONDUCT OF CUMYN.</span></h2>

<p>On retiring with his army, as stated in the last
chapter, Edward left behind him a considerable
force to protect that part of Scotland which lay
contiguous to England, and which he seemed determined,
if possible, to annex to his own dominions.
Although his invasion had been productive
of very disastrous consequences to the Scots, they
did not suffer so much on this, as they had done
on former occasions. The judicious orders issued
by the Guardian, for driving the cattle&mdash;which
formed the principal part of their wealth&mdash;to inaccessible
parts of the country, contributed not
only to their safety, but also to the disappointment
and distress of the enemy. On the retreat,
therefore, of the grand army of Edward, the inhabitants
were far from being that wretched and disspirited
race, which they had appeared after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
battle of Dunbar. Several of the chieftains, it
is true, had repeated their oaths of fidelity to the
invader, but the defection from the cause of liberty
was by no means general. The principal
places of strength, with the exception of Stirling,
were in the hands of the Scots; and the impregnable
fortress of <span class="locked">Dumbarton<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> had been given, by Wallace,
in consequence of his services in the cause
of his country, in charge to Sir John Stewart of
Rusky, better known by the name of Menteith.
This man had been present with Wallace at the
burning of the barns of Ayr, as well as in many other
situations of danger and difficulty. According
to Henry, when the Guardian bestowed this
charge upon him, he stipulated for the erection of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
small house for himself within the fortress, in the
building of which considerable progress had been
made, when the English army entered Scotland.
Some writers allege, that the reason which induced
Wallace to make choice of such a situation, was
the great friendship which existed between him and
Menteith, to whose society, they say, he was
much attached, and which, by this means, he
would have a better opportunity of enjoying. With
this opinion, however, we cannot agree. That
Menteith was high in the confidence of Wallace,
is sufficiently evident from his appointing him to
so important a trust&mdash;for, besides the governorship
of the castle, his situation naturally gave him
the command of a considerable part of the district
of Lennox&mdash;yet we conceive that Wallace had
other motives for selecting such a place of retirement,
than the mere pleasure of enjoying the
society of a friend, however valued that friend
might have been. The hostility which he had
excited in the breast of Edward by his conduct in
Scotland, as well as by his invasion of England,
gave him every reason to dread the revenge
of that haughty and crafty potentate; while the
vacillating character of a great proportion of the
nobility&mdash;joined to that inextinguishable jealousy
which existed against him in the minds of some of
the most powerful families&mdash;made it both desirable
and prudent to look out for a place where, in the
decline of life, he might be secure from the attempts
of his country’s enemies, as well as the
machinations of his own. The more immediate
cause, however, may have been the safety of his
surviving relations. The circumstance of so many
of them having already suffered on his account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
would, no doubt, make him consider it as a duty
incumbent on him to provide for those that remained.
His uncle, the parson of Dunipace, he had
but recently relieved from a dungeon, into which
the English had thrown him; and his mother had
frequently been obliged to fly from the fortalice of
Elderslie, in order to preserve herself from falling
into the hands of the enemy. These, we presume,
to have been the motives which induced
him to stipulate for this little sanctuary, and not
an overweening affection for the society of Menteith.
His selection of him, however, for this purpose,
shows the entire confidence he had in his
fidelity.</p>

<p>With regard to the building <span class="locked">itself,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> we have it
on record, that the workmen on one occasion had
to desist from their operations, in consequence of
the English having taken possession of the town:
they were, however, soon dislodged by Wallace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
who surprised them at midnight, and drove them
out with great slaughter. This affair is supposed
to have taken place after the battle of <span class="locked">Falkirk.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span></p>

<p>Aware that the approach of winter would render
the conveyance of military stores almost impracticable,
after his return to England, Edward
lost no time in despatching to the castles of Stirling,
Dumfries, Lochmaben, and the other fortressses
in his possession, those necessaries of
which they were most likely to be in <span class="locked">want.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
But the active and persevering character of the
enemy he had to contend with, made him apprehensive
that they would avail themselves of his
absence, and the inclemency of the season, to recover
the strengths they had lost in the last campaign;
and in this he was not mistaken, for winter
had scarcely commenced, before Wallace and the
Scottish regents laid siege to, and recaptured, several
places of importance.</p>

<p>During 1299, while hostilities were still going
on, Baliol appears to have become an object of
negociation between the Pope and the English
court, although the Pontiff had solemnly and repeatedly
declared his fixed determination never to
interfere in the affairs of Scotland; assuring Edward
of his conviction “that the Scots were a false and
treacherous people,” and that he believed they
had a design against his life. Still his liege-lord
held the King of Scotland in unmitigated <span class="locked">captivity,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>
till, at the urgent entreaty of the Pope, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>delivered over to the Papal Nuncio, with liberty to
dispose of him and his English possessions as the
Pontiff thought proper. It is possible that the renunciation
of the guardianship on the part of Wallace,
conduced as much as any thing else to Baliol’s
release; and it is likely that the crafty usurper
conceived the measure might distract the regency,
by exciting anew the jealous competition among the
former claimants of the crown. If this were his intention
he must have felt grievously disappointed
on learning that the regents, awed, no doubt, by the
watchfulness and influence of the late Guardian,
continued to act in concert, and had even laid siege
to the strong castle of Stirling, which he had been
at such pains to repair and <span class="locked">provision.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> The vigour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
with which the operations against this fortress
were carried on, soon compelled the besieged
to despatch messengers to Edward to acquaint
him with their situation; and fully aware of the
importance of the place, and determined to relieve
it, the latter assembled his army at Berwick early
in November. His barons, however, he found intractable.
Certain charters had not been confirmed,
and certain lands in Scotland had been gifted
away to strangers without their consent and contrary
to his engagements; in consequence of which
they resolutely refused to proceed beyond Berwick,
alleging, among other causes, the impolicy of undertaking
a campaign beset with so many dangers,
at such an advanced season of the year. Edward
and his barons were alike obstinate, and the latter
retired in dudgeon; while he, in the same humour,
marched forward with the remains of his army to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the relief of Stirling. He had not, however, proceeded
far, before he became acquainted with the
numbers and formidable position occupied by the
Scots. Thus circumstanced, he retraced his steps,
and allowed the garrison to negociate a <span class="locked">surrender;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span>
in consequence of which, the castle was shortly after
given up to Lord Soulis, one of the Regents, who
placed it under the charge of Sir William Olifant,
a brave knight, who proved himself in every respect
deserving of the trust reposed in him.</p>

<p>John Cumyn, the other Regent, is said to have
also gained advantages over the enemy, and to
have, in other respects, conducted himself so as
in a great measure to efface the remembrance of
his former offences. Indeed, so well pleased were
the generality of his countrymen with his proceedings
on the commencement of the regency, that
we find some of the old historians applying to him
the epithet of the “<i>Gude Scottisman</i>.” From
this circumstance, some have supposed, that John
Cumyn, the Regent here alluded to, was not the
same who behaved with such treachery at the battle
of Falkirk. In this opinion they at first sight
appear to be countenanced by Wyntown, who
styles him “<i>Jhon Comyn, that was Jhon Comyn’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
swn</i>;” but, it must be recollected that there
were three Cumyns of the name of John, father,
son, and grandson.</p>

<p>The gleam of popularity which at this time
shone out upon Cumyn, is not to be wondered at.
Placed in a situation desirable, on account of the
prospect it opened up to his ambition&mdash;and which
he could only retain by a line of policy in unison
with the spirit of liberty which his predecessor
had infused into the people&mdash;he not only exerted
himself against the common enemy, but
used every effort in his power to gain the affections
of his countrymen. His large possessions
and great wealth, which, it is said, were never equalled
by those of any family in Scotland, enabled
him to relieve the people from various imposts necessary
for the support of the government; while
the applications which the Regency made to France,
for troops to assist them in the defence of their
independence, were answered by supplies of grain
and wine, which, being a boon, were sold out to
the people at half their current value.</p>

<p>This procedure would no doubt ensure him the
good opinion of that class of his countrymen, who
could not see the high price, which, in a national
point of view, was paid for the comforts thus procured
them. The more thinking party, however,
saw through the policy of France, in thus attempting
to cajole the Scots with a few cargoes of wine,
instead of fulfilling the terms of the treaty, offensive
and defensive, that existed between them.
From the dissatisfaction which this conduct, on the
part of their allies, occasioned among the Scottish
nobility, it was determined to send commissioners
to France, to demand that assistance which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
were bound to afford; and, if unsuccessful, they
were instructed to proceed to Rome, and lay their
grievances at the feet of the Apostolic Father, and
to solicit his interference to restrain the English
monarch from renewing his aggressions upon their
country.</p>

<span class="subhead">EDWARD AGAIN INVADES SCOTLAND.&mdash;SIEGE OF CARLAVEROCK.&mdash;MISCELLANEOUS
OCCURENCES DURING THE SIEGE.</span></h2>

<p>The accounts which Edward was daily receiving
of the progress of the Scots, determined him to
renew hostilities, as soon as circumstances would
permit. Having regained the good will of his barons,
by a gracious compliance with their demands,
by writs tested, on 29th December 1299, he summoned
all who owed him military service in England
and elsewhere, to attend at Carlisle on the
feast of the nativity of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>1300. “On the day appointed,” (1st July),
says an <span class="locked">eye-witness,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> “the whole host was ready,
and the good King, with his household, then set
forward against the Scots, not in coats and surcoats,
but on powerful and costly chargers, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
that they might not be taken by surprise, well and
securely armed.</p>

<p>“There were many rich caparisons embroidered
on silks and satins; many a beautiful penon
fixed to a lance; and many a banner displayed.</p>

<p>“And afar off was the noise heard of the neighing
of horses; mountains and vallies were every
where covered with sumpter-horses and waggons
with provisions, and sacks of tents and pavilions.</p>

<p>“And the days were long and fine. They proceeded
by easy journeys, arranged in four squadrons.”</p>

<p>The first squadron was led by Henry de Lacy,
Earl of <span class="locked">Lincoln.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span></p>

<p>The second was under John, Earl of Warren
and Surrey.</p>

<p>King Edward conducted the third squadron
himself, and, says the fore-mentioned author,
“brought up the rear so closely and ably, that
none of the others were left behind. In his banner
were three leopards courant of fine gold, set
on red; fierce, haughty, and cruel; thus placed, to
signify, that, like them, the King is dreadful fierce,
and proud to his enemies, for his bite is slight to
none who inflame his anger; not but his kindness
is soon rekindled towards such as seek his friendship
or submit to his power.” This part of his
character, the Scots would not call in question.</p>

<p>The fourth squadron was led by “Prince Edward,
a youth of seventeen years, and bearing
arms for the first time. He was a well-proportioned
and handsome person, of a courteous disposition,
and intelligent; and desirous of finding an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
occasion to display his prowess. He managed his
steed wonderfully well, and bore with a blue label
the arms of the good King his father.” John de St
John, an experienced warrior, was in close attendance
upon the Prince, ready to instruct him in
what his duty required.</p>

<p>Eighty-seven of the most illustrious vassals of
the Crown of England, with their retainers, were
in this array, including knights of Bretagne, Lorraine,
and renegades of Scotland, among whom
we find Alexander de Baliol, brother to the King
of Scots, Patrick, Earl of Dunbar, and his son,
Sir Simon Frazer, Henry de Graham, and Richard
Siward. This formidable and splendid assemblage
of feudal power, which completely filled the road
from Newcastle, halted about nine miles south of
Dumfries, for the purpose of besieging the Castle
of Carlaverock, a stronghold belonging to Herbert
Maxwell, chief of a powerful border clan of that
name, and who had refused to surrender to a summons
which Edward had sent forward. The siege
of this place has been passed over, or very slightly
noticed, by the historians of both countries.
Langtoft merely <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">passing over, in this brief manner, a siege which
not only engaged the attention of the King, but
also interrupted the progress of his whole army.</p>

<p>The account which is given by Walter of Exeter,
is not only valuable from its being the only
well-authenticated description extant, by an eye-witness
of the leaguer of any of the Scottish fastnesses
during this period, but also from its being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
extremely interesting, by the minuteness of its details,
and the graphic manner in which the author
has pourtrayed the appearance and demeanour of
the combatants. It would be doing the reader injustice
to present it to him otherwise than in the
nervous, elegant, and appropriate language of the
accomplished translator.</p>

<p>“Carlaverock was so strong a castle, that it did
not fear a siege, therefore the King came himself,
because it would not consent to surrender. But
it was always furnished for its defence, whenever
it was required, with men, engines, and provisions.
Its shape was like that of a shield; for it had only
three sides all round, with a tower in each
angle; but one of them was a double one, so high,
so long, and so large, that under it was the gate,
with a draw-bridge, well made and strong, and a
sufficiency of other defences. It had good walls,
and good ditches filled to the edge with water;
and I believe there never was seen a castle more
beautifully situated; for at once could be seen the
Irish sea towards the west, and to the north a fine
country, surrounded by an arm of the sea, so that
no creature born could approach it on two sides,
without putting himself in danger of the sea.</p>

<p>“Towards the south it was not easy, because
there were numerous dangerous defiles of wood,
and marshes, and ditches, where the sea is on each
side of it, and where the river reaches it; and
therefore it was necessary for the host to approach
it towards the east, where the hill slopes.</p>

<p>“And in that place by the King’s commands,
his battalions were formed into three, as they were
to be quartered; then were the banners arranged,
when one might observe many a warrior exercising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
his horse: and there appeared three thousand
brave men at arms; then might be seen gold and
silver, and the noblest and best of all rich colours,
so as entirely to illuminate the valley; consequently,
those of the castle, on seeing us arrive, might, as I
well believe, deem that they were in greater peril
than they could ever before remember. And as soon
as we were thus drawn up, we were quartered by
the Marshall, and then might be seen houses built
without carpenters or masons, of many different
fashions, and many a cord stretched, with white
and coloured cloth, with many pins, driven into
the ground, many a large tree cut down to make
huts; and leaves, herbs and flowers gathered in
the woods, which were strewed within; and then
our people took up their quarters.</p>

<p>“Soon afterwards, it fortunately happened, that
the navy arrived with the engines and <span class="locked">provisions;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and then the footmen began to march against the
castle; then might be seen stones arrows, and
quarreaux, to fly among them; but so effectually
did those within exchange their tokens with those
without, that in one short hour there were many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
persons wounded and maimed, and I know not
how many killed.</p>

<p>“When the men-at-arms saw that the footmen
had sustained such losses who had begun the attack,
many ran there, many leaped here, and many
used such haste to go, that they did not deign
to speak to any one. Then might there be seen
such kind of stones thrown as if they would beat
hats and helmets to powder, and break shields and
targets in pieces; for to kill and wound was the
game at which they played. Great shouts arose
among them, when they perceived that any mischief
occurred.</p>

<p>“There, first of all, I saw the good Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Bertram de Montbouchier, on whose shining silver
shield were three red pitchers, with besants,
in a black border.</p>

<p>“With him Gerard de Gondronville, an active
and handsome bachelor. He had a shield neither
more nor less than vaire. These were not resting
idle, for they threw up many a stone, and suffered
many a heavy blow.</p>

<p>“The first body was composed of Bretons, and
the second were of Lorrain, of which none found
the other tardy; so that they afforded encouragement
and emulation to others to resemble them.
Then came to assail the castle, Fitz-Marmaduke,
with a banner and a great and full troop of good
and select bachelors.</p>

<p>“Robert de Willoughby I saw bore gold fretty
azure.</p>

<p>“Robert de Hamsart I saw arrive, fully prepared,
with five followers, holding a red shield by
the straps, containing three silver stars.</p>

<p>“Henry de Graham had his arms red as blood,
with a white saltire and chief, on which he had
three red escalop shells.</p>

<p>“Thomas de Richmont, who a second time
collected some lances, had red armour, with a
chief and two gemells of gold. These did not act
like discreet people, nor as persons enlightened
by understanding; but as if they had been inflamed
and blinded with pride and despair, for they made
their way right forwards to the very brink of the
ditch.</p>

<p>“And those of Richmont passed at this moment
quite to the bridge, and demanded entry;
they were answered with ponderous stones and
cornues. Willoughby in his advances received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
stone on the middle of his breast, which ought to
have been protected by his shield, if he had deigned
to use it.</p>

<p>“Fitz-Marmaduke had undertaken to endure
as much in that affair as the others could bear, for
he was like a post; but his banner received many
stains, and many a rent difficult to mend.</p>

<p>“Hamsart bore himself so nobly, that from his
shield fragments might often be seen to fly in the
air; for he, and those of Richmont, drove the
stones upwards, as if it were rotten, whilst those
within defended themselves by loading their heads
and necks with the weight of heavy blows.</p>

<p>“Those led by Graham did not escape, for
there were not above two who returned unhurt,
or brought back their shields entire.</p>

<p>“Then you might hear the tumult begin. With
them were intermixed a great body of the King’s
followers, all of whose names, if I were to repeat,
and recount their brave actions, the labour would
be too heavy, so many were there, and so well
did they behave. Nor would this suffice, without
those of the retinue of the King’s son, great numbers
of whom came there in noble array; for
many a shield, newly painted, and splendidly adorned,
many a helmet, and many a burnished
hat, many a rich gambezon, garnished with silk,
tow and cotton, were there to be seen, of divers
forms and fashions.</p>

<p>“There I saw Ralph de Gorges, a newly dubbed
knight, fall more than once to the ground
from stones and the crowd, for he was of so
haughty a spirit that he would not deign to retire.
He had all his harness and attire mascally of gold
and azure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
“Those who were on the wall, Robert de Tony
severely harassed; for he had in his company the
good Richard de Rokeley, who so well plied those
within, that he frequently obliged them to retreat.
He had his shield painted mascally of red and
ermine.</p>

<p>“Adam de la Forde mined the walls as well
as he could, for the stones flew in and out as
thick as rain, by which many were disabled. He
bore, in clear blue, three gold lioncels rampant
crowned.</p>

<p>“The good Baron of Wigtown received such
blows, that it was the astonishment of all that he
was not stunned; for, without excepting any lord
present, none shewed a more resolute or unembarrassed
countenance. He bore, within a bordure
indented, three gold stars on sable.</p>

<p>“Many a heavy and crushing stone did he of
Kirkbride receive, but he placed before him a
white shield with a green cross engrailed. So
stoutly was the gate of the castle assailed by him,
that never did smith with his hammer strike his
iron as he and his did there. Notwithstanding
there were showered upon them such huge stones,
quarrels, and arrows, that with wounds and bruises
they were so hurt and exhausted, that it was with
great difficulty they were able to retire.</p>

<p>“But as soon as they had retreated, he of
Clifford, being advised of it, and like one who had
no intention that those within should have repose,
sent his banner there, and as many as could properly
escort it, with Bartholomew de Badlesmere,
and John de Cromwell, as those who could best
perform his wishes; for whilst their breath lasted,
none of them neglected to stoop and pick up the
stones to throw them, and to attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
“But the people of the castle would not permit
them to remain there long. Badlesmere, who
all that day behaved himself well and bravely, bore
on white, with a blue label a red fess between
two gemelles. Cromwell, the brave and handsome,
who went gliding between the stones, bore on blue,
a white lion rampant, double-tailed, and crowned
with gold; but think not that he brought it away,
or that it was not bruised, so much was it battered
and defaced by stones before he retreated.</p>

<p>“After these two, La Warde and John de Gray
returned there, and renewed the attack. Those
within, who were fully expecting it, bent their
bows and cross-bows, and prepared their espringalls,
and kept themselves quite ready both to
throw and to hurl.</p>

<p>“Then the followers of my Lord of Brittany
recommenced the assault, fierce and daring as lions
of the mountains, and every day improving in both
the practice and use of arms. Their party soon
covered the entrance of the castle, for none could
have attacked it more furiously; not, however,
that it was so subdued, that those who came after
them would not have a share in their labours; but
they left more than enough for them also.</p>

<p>“After these, the people of my Lord of Hastings
assembled there, where I saw John de Cretinques
in danger of losing a horse. When upon
it, one came beneath pricking it with an arrow;
but he did not seem to be dissembling, he used
such haste to strike him. On his white shield he
caused to be depicted a red chevron, with three
mullets.</p>

<p>“He who bore a dancette and billets of gold
on blue, John Deincourt by name, rushed on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the assault, and there extremely well performed
his duty.</p>

<p>“It was also a fine sight to see the good brothers
of Berkeley receiving numerous blows; and
the brothers Basset likewise, of whom the eldest
bore thus,&mdash;ermine, a red chief indented, charged
with three gold mullets; the other, with three
shells; found the passages straitened. Those within
continually relieved one another; for always as
one became fatigued, another returned fresh and
stout; and, notwithstanding such assaults were made
upon them, they would not surrender, but so defended
themselves, that they resisted those who
attacked, all that day and night, and the next day
until tierce. But their courage was considerably
depressed during the attack, by the brother Robert,
who sent numerous stones from the robinet,
without cessation, from the dawn of the preceding
day until the evening. Moreover, on the other
side, he was erecting three other engines, very
large, of great power, and very destructive, which
cut down and cleave whatever they strike. Fortified
town, citadel, nor barrier&mdash;nothing is protected
from their strokes. Yet those within did
not flinch, until some of them were slain; but then
each began to repent of his obstinacy, and to be
dismayed. The pieces fell in such manner, wherever
the stones entered, that when they struck either
of them, neither iron cap nor wooden target
could save him from a wound.</p>

<p>“And when they saw that they could not hold
out any longer, or endure more, the companions
begged for peace, and put out a pennon; but he
that displayed it was shot with an arrow, by some
archer, through the hand into the face; then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
begged that they would do no more to him, for
they will give up the castle to the King, and
throw themselves upon his mercy. And the marshal
and constable, who always remained on the
spot, at that notice forbad the assault, and these
surrendered the castle to them.”</p>

<p>The besieged, who had thus retarded the progress
of this mighty host, were now passed in review
before Edward, and, <i>including all ranks</i>,
were found to amount to “<i>sixty men</i>,” “who
were,” says our author, “beheld with much astonishment.”&mdash;“They
were all kept and guarded,
till the King commanded that life and limb should
be given them, and ordered to each of them a new
garment:” “But this account of the treatment of
the prisoners,” says Mr Nicolas, “differs entirely
from that in the Chronicle of Lanercost, where
it is said that many of them were hung.”</p>

<p>The banner of Edward now waved on the battlement
of Carlaverock Castle, along with those of
St Edmond, St George, St Edward, Sir John
Segrave, the Earl of Hereford, and that of Lord
Clifford, to whom Edward had given it in charge.
The army then proceeded on their <span class="locked">march.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span></p>

<p>While the English army were encamped before
Carlaverock, Winchelsea, Archbishop of Canterbury,
arrived with a bull, directed to Edward,
from the Pope.</p>

<p>The application which, as has already been stated,
the Scottish commissioners were instructed to
make to King Philip for the stipulated assistance
having at first been evaded, and afterwards finally
refused&mdash;the embarrassing situation of his own affairs
affording him a plausible pretext for withholding
the aid necessary for the relief of his allies&mdash;the
Scots, according to their instructions,
proceeded to lay their complaints before the Court
of Rome. Boniface listened with complacency
to their grievances, and readily undertook to interpose
his authority in their behalf. For this
purpose, he addressed to Edward a letter of admonition,
exhorting him to desist from any further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
attempts to subvert the liberties of a kingdom over
which he had no lawful claim. The groundless
nature of the pretensions he had set up, the Pontiff
proceeded, at considerable length, to explain&mdash;being,
no doubt, enabled to do so, from the information
furnished him by the commissioners. Among
other matters, he reminded him, that the mere circumstance
of his having negotiated with the Scots,
for the marriage of his son with the heiress of Scotland,
must prove fatal to any plea he might advance
in favour of his being the feudal lord of that
kingdom, as he would find no one weak enough
to believe that he would have submitted to negociate,
when he had a right to command. “He
also,” says a respectable historian, “mentioned
several striking facts which fell within the compass
of Edward’s own knowledge, particularly that
Alexander, when he did homage to the King,
openly and expressly declared in his presence, that
he swore fealty <i>not for his crown, but for the
lands which he held in England</i>; and the Pope’s
letter might have passed for a reasonable one, had
he not subjoined his <i>own</i> claim to be <i>liege lord of
Scotland</i>, a claim which had not once been heard
of, but which, with a singular confidence, he asserted
to be full and entire, and derived from the
most remote antiquity.” This letter Boniface concluded,
by exhorting him, in his name, to set at
liberty all those ecclesiastics and others belonging
to the country whom he had imprisoned, and to
remove all officers he had appointed to places of
trust in the kingdom, contrary to the wishes of
the people; directing him, if he conceived he had
still any reasons to allege in support of his pretensions,
to send persons properly authorized to Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
where he, the Pope, would hear the case, and
within six months give an impartial decision. To
these exhortations the Archbishop added his own,
urging, among other things, the propriety of his
yielding obedience to so sacred an authority, observing,
that Jerusalem would not fail to protect
her citizens, and to cherish, like Mount Zion,
those who trusted in the Lord. At the conclusion
of this address, which was made in the presence
of Prince Edward and the assembled nobles,
the King became furious, and with a great oath
exclaimed, “I will not be silent or at rest, either
for Mount Zion or for Jerusalem, but, as long as
there is breath in my nostrils, I will defend what
all the world knows to be my right.” On calmer
reflection, however, he saw the necessity of returning
a milder answer to the admonition of his
adviser, in which he promised to consult his parliament,
and send messengers to Rome to acquaint
his Spiritual Father with the result of their deliberations.</p>

<p>In a parliament assembled some time after at
Lincoln, the Pope’s bull was submitted to the consideration
of the English Barons; and in his reply,
Edward attempted to prove the superiority of England
by historical facts, deduced from the period
of Brutus the Trojan, who, he said, founded the
British monarchy in the age of Eli and Samuel.
He then supports his position by all the events
which passed in the island before the arrival
of the Romans: And, after laying great stress on
the extensive dominions and the heroic victories
of King Arthur, he vouchsafes at last to descend to
the time of Edward the Elder, from which period he
has chosen to begin his claim of superiority. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
asserts it as a fact <i>notorious, and confirmed by the
records of antiquity</i>, that the English monarchs
had often conferred the kingdom of Scotland on
their own subjects&mdash;had dethroned those vassal-kings
when unfaithful to them, and had substituted
others in their stead. He displays, with
great pomp, the full and complete homage which
William had done to Henry II.&mdash;without mentioning
the formal abolition of that extorted deed by
King Richard, and the renunciation of all future
claims of the same nature. Yet in this paper he
begins with a solemn appeal to the Almighty, the
searcher of hearts, for his own firm persuasion of
the justice of his claim; and no less than a hundred
and four barons, assembled in parliament at
Lincoln, concurred in maintaining before the Pope,
under their seals, the validity of the pretensions.
At the same time, they took care to inform Boniface,
that although they had justified their cause
before him, they did not acknowledge him as their
judge: the crown of England was free and sovereign:
they had sworn to maintain all its prerogatives;
and would never permit the King himself,
were he willing, to relinquish its independence.</p>

<p>Edward, on leaving Carlaverock, now advanced
into Galloway, and took several castles in that province.
He appears to have been at Lochroieton
on the 17th July, and at Kirkcudbright on the
22d of same month. On 29th August he returned
to Carlaverock. He was at Dumfries on the
24th October, and again at Carlaverock on the
1st <span class="locked">November.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> His own operations appear, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
this occasion, to have been in a great measure
confined to the south of <span class="locked">Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> Detachments
of his army, however, extended themselves
in different directions; and various conflicts took
place between them and the Scottish <i>guerilla</i> parties
under Wallace. A strong division of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
English army, commanded by the Earl of Warren,
advanced also as far as Irvine, and came in
contact with the Scottish forces, headed by the
Regents. The field was keenly contested for some
time; but the Scots were at last compelled to fall
back before the repeated charges of their more
numerous opponents. Another portion of the English
army laid waste Clydesdale; and after destroying
Bothwell, advanced to Lesmahago&mdash;to
the Abbey church of which, a number of the inhabitants
had fled for safety. This sanctuary,
however, according to tradition, did not avail them.
Their merciless invaders set fire to the sacred
edifice, and many of the Scots perished miserably
in the flames. During the perpetration of this
tragic act, Wallace, who followed the tract of the
destroyers, was forced, it is said, to conceal himself
in a cave, four miles distant from the scene of
barbarity, carefully watching, by his scouts, the
motions of the enemy. This cave still goes by
his name, and is pointed out by the country people
as an object of curiosity to strangers.</p>

<p>While this warfare was carrying on by his detached
squadrons, Edward was concerting measures
for permanently annexing to his own dominions,
the district he had overrun. For this purpose,
he employed numerous bodies of his own
subjects, in repairing and fortifying the different
places of strength which had surrendered to his
arms; and the reluctance of the Scots to assist in
the subjugation of their country, appears evident
from his being compelled to bring labourers, at a
considerable expense, from the northern counties
of <span class="locked">England.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
A large portion of the provisions required for his
troops he seems also to have been under the necessity
of bringing from Ireland. Between Whitehaven
and Carlaverock we find William de Torni, master
of a vessel belonging to the Isle of Man, employed
in carrying flour for the supply of the army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
In the wardrobe account there is also an <span class="locked">entry,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span>
from which it may be inferred, that the destruction
of the mills formed part of the system which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the Scots resorted to for the annoyance of their
<span class="locked">enemies.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span></p>

<p>As the campaign had hitherto been productive
of no result adequate to the expense incurred, Edward
now affected to listen to the remonstrances of
Philip and Boniface, and agreed to a truce with the
Scots in arms against him. The negociation took
place at Paris between the English envoys and the
Scottish commissioners at the French court, and
was finally ratified by Edward at Dumfries on the
30th October 1300, when he expressed himself
highly offended with the English envoys for allowing
Baliol’s name, as King of Scotland, to appear
in the treaty. This truce was to last from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Hallowmas to <span class="locked">Whitsunday;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> and in consequence
of it, all the English troops except those in garrison
were withdrawn from Scotland and disbanded.
Edward then summoned his parliament at Lincoln,
and returned the answer to Boniface to which we
have already alluded.</p>

<p>1301. After the conclusion of the treaty,
Wallace is supposed to have gone on a visit to
France, in consequence of the repeated invitations
of Philip, who was no doubt anxious to behold a
man whose name had become familiar at every
court in Europe, and whose exertions in his own
country had so often relieved himself from the hostile
visits of the King of England.</p>

<p>On his way, the vessel in which he had embarked
along with a few select friends, is said to have
been attacked by a noted pirate of the name of
Longueville, at that time the terror of the seas,
and the Paul Jones of his day. After a desperate
conflict, Wallace and his party succeeded in boarding
the enemy; and Longueville, being vanquished
in a personal combat with Wallace, surrendered at
discretion. The gallant manner, however, in which
he acted during the fight, gained him the esteem
of our hero, who subsequently discovered that he
was a French nobleman, and, at one time, high in
favour at court, but who had fallen under the displeasure
of the King, in consequence of having killed
a knight in the royal presence; for which offence his
estates were forfeited, and himself banished from the
kingdom. Smarting under these indignities, he had
commenced a system of piracy, for which he was
outlawed, and every avenue to the royal clemency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
shut against him. Wallace, on arriving at Paris,
found himself so well received by the French
monarch&mdash;who no doubt expected his assistance
against the English in Guienne&mdash;that he ventured
to solicit, and, after some difficulty, obtained a
pardon for Longueville, who had accompanied
him to Paris in disguise.</p>

<p>Various stories are told of the adventures of
Wallace in France; but as the histories of that
country are in general silent regarding them, most
of our authors have considered them fabulous;
and some even carry their incredulity so far as
to doubt of his ever having been there. But as
he appears evidently, on one or more occasions,
to have withdrawn himself from Scotland, and as
those writers who doubt of his being in France
have not accounted for the chasms that his absence
naturally makes in his history, nor appear
to have any thing to urge against his visits to that
country but their <i>doubts</i>; we cannot allow unsupported
<i>misgivings</i> to stand in opposition to the recorded
testimony of ancient writers, who ought
to have known more of transactions near their
own days than authors who wrote many ages
after them&mdash;particularly as the circumstance in
question could serve no political or party purpose
at the time; and of course, could afford no temptation
for mis-statement. We may also remark,
that the adventure with Longueville is corroborated
by traditions still existing in the country, as
well as by the fact of a family in Scotland, not
long extinct, having derived their pedigree from
that brave man; who, according to the law of arms
in those days, thought himself bound to follow the
fortunes of his conqueror. Longueville is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
have accompanied Wallace to Scotland, where he
had lands assigned him; and the following notice
in the Statistical Account of the parish of
Kinfauns, goes a considerable way to establish
the truth of what is here related:&mdash;“In the Castle
of Kinfauns is kept a large old sword, probably
made about five hundred years ago, and to be
used by both hands. It is shaped like a broadsword,
and is five feet nine inches long, two and
and a half inches broad at the hilt, and of a proportionable
thickness, with a round knob at the upper
end, near eight inches in circumference. This
terrible weapon bears the name of <i>Charteris’s
Sword</i>, and probably belonged to Sir Thomas
Charteris, commonly called Thomas de Longueville,
once proprietor of the estate of Kinfauns.
Sir Thomas Charteris, <i>alias</i> Longueville, was a
native of France, and of an ancient family in that
country. If credit can be given to accounts of
such remote dates, when he was at the court of
Philip le Bel, in the end of the thirteenth century,
he had a dispute with, and killed a French nobleman,
in the King’s presence. He escaped, but
was refused pardon.</p>

<p>“Having for several years infested the seas as
a pirate, known by the name of the Red Reiver,
from the colour of the flags he carried on his ship,
in May 1301 or 1302 (by Adamson’s chronology),
Sir William Wallace, in his way to France, encountered
and took him prisoner. At Wallace’s
intercession, the French King conferred on him a
pardon, and the honour of knighthood. He accompanied
Wallace on his return to Scotland, and
was ever after his faithful friend, and aiding in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
exploits. Upon that hero’s being betrayed and
carried to England, Sir Thomas Charteris retired
to Lochmaben, where he remained till Robert
Bruce began to assert his right to the crown of
Scotland. He joined Bruce, and was, if we may
believe Adamson, who refers to <span class="locked">Barbour,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> the
first who followed that King into the water, at the
taking of Perth, January 8, 1313.</p>

<p>“Bruce rewarded his bravery by giving him
lands in the neighbourhood of Perth, which appear
to be those of Kinfauns, and which continued in
the family of Charteris for many years. It is to
this ancient knight, and to the antique sword
above-mentioned, that Adamson refers in these
lines (Book VI.) of his ‘Muses Threnodie:’</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;‘<i>Kinfauns</i>, which famous <i>Longoveil</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometime did hold; whose auncient sword of steele<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remaines unto this day, and of that land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is chiefest evident.’&mdash;p. 158.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“About forty years ago, upon opening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
burying vault under the aisle of the church of Kinfauns,
erected by this family, there was found a
headpiece, or kind of helmet, made of several
folds of linen, or some strong stuff, painted over
with broad stripes of blue and white, which seems
to have been part of the fictitious armour wherein
the body of Sir Thomas Longueville, or Charteris,
had been <span class="locked">disposed.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span></p>

<p>“Some persons of the surname of Charteris,”
says the editor of the Perth edition of Wallace,
“lairds of Kinfauns, and of Cuthilgourdy, were
provosts of Perth, and would make a distinguished
figure in the heroic annals of Perth, if the old
writs of that city were properly displayed.”</p>

<p>According to the same authority, there were
families of the name of Charteris in Scotland, long
before the time assigned to Thomas de Longueville.
Andrew de Charteris, who swore fealty to
Edward in 1296, is said to have been the ancestor
of the noble family of Wemyss.</p>

<span class="subhead">EDWARD AGAIN INVADES SCOTLAND.&mdash;SIR SIMON FRAZER DESERTS
THE ENGLISH, AND JOINS HIS COUNTRYMEN.&mdash;WALLACE
RETURNS TO SCOTLAND.&mdash;BATTLE OF ROSLIN.</span></h2>

<p>The truce which circumstances had extorted from
Edward, was no sooner expired, than the campaign
was opened by a fresh invasion of Scotland. The
English army again advanced as far as Linlithgow,
where, fixing their head-quarters, they commenced
building a fortress for the same object as had induced
them to rear similar structures in the south. The
treaty of peace had not yet been concluded with
the King of France; and Edward anxiously endeavoured
to detach him from the interests of the
Scots. In this he was successful; for, by giving
up his allies, the Flemings, to the chastisement of
Philip, and sacrificing a lucrative branch of trade,
in order to gratify his enmity against the Scots, he
obtained the King of France’s consent to a separate
peace, stipulating only for a truce with Scotland,
to endure till St Andrew’s day, 1302,&mdash;after which
period, Edward was left at liberty to prosecute his
views against that country.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the cause of independence
acquired a valuable accession in the person of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Sir Simon Frazer, who at last&mdash;awakened to the
injuries of his country, and a just sense of his own
unnatural conduct&mdash;deserted the standard of Edward,
and enrolled himself among the asserters of
the liberty of <span class="locked">Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> The talents and bravery
of this leader more than counterbalanced the loss
which the patriots had sustained in the defection
of the Bishop of Glasgow; who, on the 7th October
1300, at Holmcoltrum, had renewed his former
fealty to Edward, swearing upon the consecrated
host, and upon the <i>Croyz Gneytz</i><a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and
<i>Black Rood</i> of Scotland; in consequence, as is
supposed, of a remonstrance from Boniface, who
now thought proper to espouse the interest of Edward.</p>

<p>On hearing of the situation of Scotland, Wallace
withdrew from the French court, and returned
home. What services he was enabled to
render his country during his absence, do not appear
in any of our records.</p>

<p>1302. After the expiry of the truce, Edward sent
John de Segrave with an army of 20,000 men into
Scotland, who, having advanced to the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
of Roslin, divided his troops into three divisions,
for the purpose of procuring forage. In the
meantime, John Cumyn and Simon Frazer, having
collected a body of eight thousand Scots, suddenly
fell upon the first division, which they defeated
with great slaughter. While engaged in collecting
the spoil, the second division came in sight,
on which the Scots, elated with the success they
had already obtained, stood resolutely to their
arms, charged, and, after a desperate conflict,
again drove their enemies from the field. After
this double victory, the Scots, exhausted with the
fatigues of the day, were preparing to refresh
themselves, when their scouts brought notice that
the third division of their enemies was at hand.
Their leaders flew from rank to rank, beseeching
them to make one effort more to preserve the
glory they had acquired; and having equipped the
followers of the camp in the arms of their slain
enemies, they again commenced the bloody strife,
with that enthusiasm which the remembrance of
their former victories inspired. The fury of the
Scottish charge decided the third battle: the English
were once more thrown into confusion, and
fled in the greatest terror, leaving behind them all
their camp-equipage a prey to the conquerors.
The advantages resulting from this day’s successes
were not thrown away: the Scots every where
flocked to the assistance of their countrymen; and
the fortresses which Edward possessed in the south
of Scotland, were quickly recovered, and garrisoned
by their lawful masters.</p>

<p>Respecting the events of this day of triumph
for the Scottish arms, the historians of the two
countries are not exactly agreed. According to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Langtoft, Sir John de Segrave, with his son and
brother, were surprised in their beds by the Scots,
who captured sixteen knights, among whom were
Sir Thomas Neville and Sir Ralf de Cofferer, the
treasurer of Edward, who, on interceding with Sir
Simon Frazer for his life, was sternly reminded by
him of the defalcations he had committed in his
office, by defrauding himself and others of their
wages. Having upbraided him with his unpriestly
conduct, he struck off his hands, as being polluted
with the wages of iniquity, and afterwards
severed his head from his body, by a blow with
his sword.</p>

CARRIES OFF THE RECORDS OF THE MONASTERIES.&mdash;MARCHES
THROUGH THE COUNTRY.&mdash;WALLACE FOLLOWS THE INVADERS.</span></h2>

<p>There is no certain account of Wallace having
been present at the battle of Roslin:&mdash;if he was, it
must have been only in a private capacity, he not being
mentioned by any author as holding a command
on that occasion. According to some, he was absent
from the country at the time; but this, however,
seems to be contradicted by the Scotichronicon,
where it is said, that, <i>after</i> the battle of Roslin,
he went on board of a merchant vessel, and, with a
few companions, again sailed for France. Henry,
whose strong partiality would not have omitted so
excellent an opportunity for aggrandizing his hero,
had there been any authority in the narrative of
Blair for so doing, passes over the circumstance in
silence. This conduct in an author so strongly
biassed in favour of the subject of his biography,
is not only a proof of the absence of Wallace from
the field of Roslin, but a strong argument in favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
of the general accuracy of his own details.
The laurels, therefore, that were gathered at Roslin,
will fall to be divided between Sir Simon Frazer
and the lord of Badenoch.</p>

<p>That Wallace returned a second time to the
court of France, is asserted in the most positive
manner by the Minstrel, and is in part corroborated
by the Scotichronicon. The particular periods
of his history, however, which those visits occupied,
it is rather difficult to ascertain. That the
first occurred after the battle of Falkirk is without
doubt; and the second immediately before, or soon
after the affair of Roslin, is almost equally certain.
As, in the first voyage, Wallace is said to
have fallen in with and captured a French pirate,
in the second, he is represented as having a similar
rencounter with an Englishman of the same
profession, who earned on his depredations principally
against the Scottish vessels. Had the Minstrel’s
work been one of pure fancy, this <i>sameness</i>
of incident, we presume, would not have occurred;&mdash;for
the judgment of the poet would no doubt
have suggested the propriety of a change of adventure.
The English pirate, who is called John of
Lyn, is first seen by the Scots, making his way out
of the Humber, displaying a red sail, and a flag
at his mast-head bearing three leopards courant,
the well-known insignia of Edward. The Scottish
merchants, who knew his ferocious disposition,
were appalled at first; but encouraged by Wallace
and his companions, they prepared themselves for
action, by stuffing sheep-skins with wool, which
appears to have been their cargo; and thus making
a kind of defensive armour, to protect them
against their better equipped assailants. On their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
refusing to surrender, the battle commenced by
a heavy discharge from bows and cross-bows on
the part of the English; and the Scots, who were
not so well supplied with missiles, kept themselves
as much as possible out of the way of the shot,
till it was nearly expended;&mdash;when, laying their
vessel along side of the enemy, Wallace and his
companions threw themselves on board the pirate,
and attacked the crew with the greatest fury. The
commander, seeing the desperation of the Scots,
and the havoc they were making amongst his men,
would gladly have made off; but the sword of Wallace
was not to be evaded. The two leaders,
therefore, engaged, and after a short rencounter,
John of Lyn was cut down by his opponent, and
his men submitted to the conqueror. In this conflict
none distinguished themselves more than Longueville,
and John Blair, the chaplain of Wallace&mdash;the
latter of whom, with three successive arrows,
shot three of the enemy, and otherwise conducted
himself with the greatest heroism. As it would not
have been becoming in Blair to have narrated such
deeds of himself, we are told by Henry, that the account
of them was inserted in the memoir of Wallace
by Thomas Gray, who acted as steersman on the
occasion. In this there is consistency, as we are
elsewhere informed, that Gray occasionally assisted
in writing the achievements of the champion of
the <span class="locked">Scots.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
On arriving “in the Sloice-hawyn,” says Henry,
Wallace made a division of the spoil among
his followers, and, presenting the merchants with
the ship, took his departure for Paris.</p>

<p>The reception he met with from Philip is reported
to have been highly flattering; and our hero
soon became involved in a number of adventures,
all sufficiently romantic; but as the French historians
appear, from their silence, to have been ignorant
of them, we must refer the curious reader
to the pages of the Minstrel. We shall only remark,
that it has been asserted by various writers,
that the name of Wallace was frequently found in
the songs of the ancient Troubadours. This, however,
may have arisen as much from the fame he
had acquired in his own country, as from any chivalrous
exploits he had performed in France. But
in whatever manner he was employed in the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
of Philip, the proceedings of Edward soon
recalled him to his native land.</p>

<p>The mortification which the reverses at Roslin
occasioned the King of England, was greatly increased
by the praises that were every where bestowed
upon the gallantry of the Scots; and the
noise which their triple victory made at the different
courts of Europe, excited a deeper and more
determined inveteracy in his mind. It is probable,
that, but for the discomfiture at Roslin, the resolution
which he had so long displayed, of reducing
Scotland to subjection, might have gradually given
way before the reflections occasioned by the immense
losses which he had sustained in his various
<span class="locked">expeditions;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> and perhaps he would have contented
himself with retaining possession of that
part of Scotland which bounded his own kingdom.
The defeat, however, of his lieutenant, and the
subsequent proceedings of the victors, awakened
afresh all the rancorous hostility of his ambitious
and unprincipled mind; and he resolved, by one
mighty effort, to overwhelm the Scots, and efface
their name from the number of the nations. In
order to accomplish this project, all the ultramarine
vassals of his crown were summoned to his
standard. In his own kingdom of England, large
levies of men and horses were raised, and the din
of preparation was heard from one extremity of
the land to the other. A powerful fleet was also
equipped, to attend the motions of the land army,
and prevent the chance of scarcity from interfering
with that work of destruction he had in contemplation.</p>

<p>1303. Wallace heard with sorrow, of the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
preparations that were making for the annihilation
of his country’s independence; and he resolved again
to join his old associates, and brave along with them
the fury of the storm that was about to burst
upon their heads. To his friends, who listened
with increasing apprehension to the progress of
the coming war, the hope of his return came
like a sunbeam through the tempest that was
blackening around them. Before, however, the
French monarch would permit his departure, the
countless host of the invader had crossed the
Tweed, and spread its desolating squadrons over
the adjacent <span class="locked">country;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> and those places which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
manifested the slightest disposition to defend their
liberties, were consigned to indiscriminate carnage.
Among the few which made any resistance,
the castle of Brechin appeared eminently conspicuous.
Under the command of the governor, Sir
Thomas Maule, this garrison maintained a most
heroic defence, and did not give in till the death
of their commander obliged them to surrender.</p>

<p>Wherever the army of Edward now appeared,
the chieftains were found anxiously waiting to
tender their submission, and again repeat their
oaths of allegiance. Some of the principal nobility,
in order to claim the merit of an early repentance,
even met the invader on the borders, and
thus procured more advantageous terms than they
otherwise would have obtained. Among those who
thus started for the goal of slavery, few shared
more largely in the wages of iniquity than Sir
John Menteith. Having met Sir Aymer de Valence
at Annan, he found means to acquire so
much of his confidence, as to induce that favourite
of Edward to obtain for him, not only a confirmation
of the governorship of Dumbarton castle, but
also an extension of his authority, over the whole
of the district of Lennox.</p>

<p>While affairs were in this situation, accounts
were brought to the English camp, that the bugle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
of Wallace had been heard at midnight among the
woods on the banks of the Tay; and a body of
troops, under the command of Sir John Butler, were
despatched in pursuit of him. This officer, two of
whose relations had already fallen by the hand of
Wallace, set forward with alacrity to execute the
service assigned to him. But, after ranging the
country in all directions, he was at last obliged to
return without having once seen the object of whom
he was in search, although the reports brought him
by his scouts, as well as the evasive answers of
the inhabitants, convinced him of the certainty of
Wallace being in the country.</p>

<p>In the early part of our narrative, we alluded to
the admirable discipline which Wallace had introduced
among his countrymen, and the facility with
which, by the sound of his horn, he could rally them
around him in cases of emergency. From the frequency
with which these calls had been made, there
was scarcely a district in Scotland where his war-note
was not understood and obeyed with alacrity.
Though this was the case, we do not mean to say,
that all who attended its summons were animated
by pure and disinterested patriotism. To the
ears of many, it probably sounded only as an invitation
to divide the property of their more wealthy
enemies; whom&mdash;under so daring and fortunate
a leader&mdash;they never doubted of being able to conquer;
and it is likely that they would have obeyed
the call with the same promptitude, had it
summoned them to a foray against some neighbouring
clan: but the generosity with which he divided
his own share of the booty among those
who had suffered most, or had borne themselves
with the greatest gallantry in the conflict, gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
him a complete ascendancy over the discordant
materials of which his little armies were frequently
composed; and rendered him more formidable to
an invader, than all the jarring aristocracy put together.
It is therefore not surprising that the report
of his return should have caused alarm among
the English.</p>

<p>On the night referred to, Wallace had landed in
Scotland, accompanied by Sir Thomas de Longueville,
John Blair, Thomas Gray, and a few other
friends who had attended him in France; and being
near one of his old places of resort, he wished
to gain some knowledge of the state of the country,
to enable him to regulate his further proceedings;
for this purpose he raised his bugle, and before the
reverberations had died away among the woodlands,
a rustling was heard among the underwood,
and presently an unarmed Scot stood before him.
From this ready adherent, who had been watching
the landing of the party, Wallace learned the situation
of the kingdom, the slaughters committed
by Edward, the submission of the regency, and the
terror that pervaded the nobility. Finding, from
the number of the English that were in the neighbourhood,
the necessity of betaking himself to
some place of concealment, he and his party were
conducted by their informer to a farm-house in a
secluded part of the country, occupied by a relation
of Wallace, of the name of Crawfurd. Here
he was joyfully received, and a hiding-place artfully
constructed in the barn, for him and his
companions, where they lurked during the search
made for them by Butler.</p>

<p>In this retreat they might have remained, till
some favourable occurrence had enabled them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
appear more openly; but it seems the unusual quantity
of provisions which Crawfurd was obliged to purchase
for the maintenance of his guests, awakened
the suspicions of the English at Dundee; and on his
return, having mentioned the examination he was
subjected to, Wallace and his party thought it prudent
to retire to a neighbouring thicket, and wait
the result. They had not long adopted this precaution,
before a body of the English made their
appearance; and having surrounded the dwelling
of Crawfurd, they discovered, in the course of search,
the lair of the fugitives.</p>

<p>The wife of Crawfurd having refused to answer
their inquiries regarding the route of her visitors,
they were proceeding, by violent measures, to
compel her to disclose the place of their retreat,
when Wallace, ascertaining the danger to which
she was exposed, advanced from the thicket,
and sounded a bold defiance to the enemy. The
situation he had chosen was such as could only
be assailed from three narrow and rugged paths.
These he proposed to guard, by dividing his little
party, which consisted only of about twenty
men, into three divisions;&mdash;with the smallest of
these he undertook to defend the path that was
most exposed to the enemy’s attacks. Butler was
not long in commencing the assault, which he did
by a simultaneous movement on all those little
parties of the Scots. The resistance, however,
which he met with, aided by the rugged nature of
the ascent, rendered all the ardour of his troops
unavailing. As the evening advanced, he called
them off; and having beat a chamade, he attempted
to persuade Wallace to surrender, by representing
the folly of continuing a resistance which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
must at last terminate in the ruin of himself and
his friends. Our hero replied, by advising him to
stand to his arms; for in place of surrendering, he
intended, before morning, to become the assailant;
and he gave him this warning, in return for the
care which he had shown for himself and his companions.
Irritated by this coolness, Butler determined
to take every precaution to prevent his escape;
and for this purpose kept his men under
arms all night. Wallace, however, was as good
as his word; for at daybreak, under cover of a
thick mist, he descended at the head of his little
band, and, before the enemy was aware of his
approach, broke into that quarter where Butler had
his station. The surprise occasioned by his sudden
appearance, threw the English into confusion,
which their uncertainty as to the number of their
assailants greatly increased; and availing himself
of the disorder into which they were thrown,
Wallace pressed forward, and came in contact with
Butler, who, after a slight resistance, fell beneath
his arm. The Scots having forced their way
through the enemy, Wallace now discovered that
their faithful host Crawfurd had been left behind.
Returning, therefore, to the charge, he was fortunately
in time to save him from the spear of an
English soldier, whom he slew; and grasping his
wounded friend in one of his arms, he carried him
off in triumph to his companions. Favoured, by
the denseness of the fog, the gallant little band
were soon lost to their pursuers. Though thus relieved
from their perilous situation, they are said
to have suffered the greatest privations in the wild
and unfrequented solitudes to which they were now
obliged to retire. However, their indefatigable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
chief, always fertile in expedients, found means to
preserve them from actual starvation, till Edward
withdrew his troops, for the purpose of resuming
his march of subjugation throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>The time which the English monarch spent in
the southern part of Scotland, it appears had not
altogether been employed in the chastisement of
those who were most active in the late insurrection.
With a policy worthy of himself, he endeavoured
to obliterate the remembrance of national
independence, by ransacking the monasteries,
and carrying off, and committing to the flames, all
the ancient records they contained; so that the
Scots in future, might have no documents to produce
which could falsify his claims to sovereignty
over <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> In this proceeding he might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
partly influenced, by the discussion he had been engaged
in with Boniface. Having, to his spiritual father,
so solemnly asserted the justice of his claim,
it was but natural that he should wish to possess
or destroy every evidence which might establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
his asseverations; and this object being, as he conceived,
so far accomplished, he proceeded with his
army, by slow marches, towards the North, exercising
the same Gothic barbarity as he went along,
and demolishing those fortresses which made any
show of resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
According to Henry, a number of the old associates
of Wallace, before his return from France,
had fled for shelter to the islands and other places
for security. Seton, Lauder and Lundy, retired
to the Bass. Malcolm Earl of Lennox, and Sir
Niel Campbell, had sought concealment along with
Bishop Sinclair in <span class="locked">Bute;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> and these last mentioned
worthies, on hearing of the arrival of Wallace,
despatched a messenger to find him out, and explain
the difficulties of their situation, and their readiness
to join him as soon as he approached their present
places of refuge. They had not to wait long,
before our hero issued forth with his little band,
and collected those who were still inclined to
struggle for the liberties of Scotland. At the head
of such he followed the invading army, and appearing
now in front, and now in rear, made frequent
and impressive attacks upon them as they
struggled through the deep and rugged defiles of
the country. But all his efforts could not retard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
the march of the invaders. They advanced to the
extremity of the kingdom, unmolested by any save
the hardy followers of our hero, who, however, as
they had attended the motions of their foes in their
laborious progress through the rough and mountainous
regions of the North, now waited their return,
and resumed the same harassing system of warfare.
Often, from an eminence, Edward could distinguish
the lofty plume of the Scottish leader, as
he dashed forward to charge some isolated corps
of the English army; and while he beheld the
enthusiasm with which his conduct inspired his
followers, and saw the disorder of his own soldiers,
hurrying to gain the protection of the main body,
his heart misgave him as to the stability of his
conquest, while Scotland contained a man whose
appearance alone was capable of inspiring his
friends with so much confidence, and his enemies
with so much dread.</p>

<p>Edward having returned from the bleak regions
of the North, took up his quarters in <span class="locked">Dunfermline,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span>
judging that his presence in the country,
during the winter, would contribute much towards
establishing his authority, as he had formerly
observed, that the places he had conquered
from the Scots in summer, were generally retaken
when the severe weather set in. He accordingly
took every precaution for the comfort of his troops;
large supplies of provisions being ordered, both
by sea and land, that his army might not be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
in such difficulties as had formerly compelled him
to retreat into England.</p>

<p>In order, also, to secure his present conquest,
he began to assimilate the state of the country
as much as possible to that of his other dominions;
and, for this purpose, he abrogated all
the old laws and customs&mdash;substituting those of
England in their <span class="locked">steed.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> In the prosecution of
this object, he announced a parliament at St Andrew’s,
which was attended by all Scotsmen of
any note, except Sir William Wallace, Sir Simon
Frazer, and Sir William Oliphant, governor of Stirling
Castle, the latter of whom refused either to
appear or surrender the trust, which had been committed
to him by Lord Soulis, who happened
then to be in France. Of this fortress, which was
now the only one that held out against him, Edward
determined to gain possession as soon as the season
would permit. As to Wallace, it is said, that, at
this time, among other great offers, he tendered
him the crown of Scotland, provided he would
accept of it in fee of the crown of England; to
which, with his usual dignity, Wallace replied,
that as he had been born a free man, he was determined
to die one; and that he preferred rather
to be the subject of his lawful sovereign, than the
crowned slave of one who had no right to his <span class="locked">allegiance.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
That Edward was sincere in this offer,
is a matter of considerable doubt;&mdash;he had already
cajoled others by similar proposals, and he might naturally
conceive, that although Wallace should not
be caught by the bait, the offer would have the
effect of exciting the suspicions of his countrymen,
and thereby weakening his influence among them.
But whatever his motives may have been, Wallace
sternly rejected all compromise, and remained
the only Scotsman who never acknowledged his
authority. On the present occasion, Sir Simon
Frazer followed his example, for which the tyrant
passed sentence of banishment and outlawry against
him. This gallant gentleman, who now adhered
to the fortunes of Wallace, had given great offence
to Edward, by the conspicuous part he had acted
at the battle of Roslin, as it was generally believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
to have been owing principally to him that the
English sustained the mortifying defeat.</p>

<p>1304. Early in the spring Edward discovered,
that, through the exertions of Wallace and Frazer,
a body of troops had been got together; in order
to disperse which, before it became too formidable,
he took the field, and proceeded towards
Stirling, in the neighbourhood of which it had
assembled. The force under the patriots, however,
when compared with the enemy, was so very insignificant,
that they prudently retreated to their
former places of refuge. On the 21st April the
siege of Stirling commenced, and continued without
intermission till the 24th July; thus occupying
Edward and his army for three months and
three days, during which time every artifice was
put in practice, and every piece of mechanism
then known was directed against the besieged.</p>

<p>The stubbornness of the garrison, however, seemed
to increase as the means of annoyance multiplied
around them; and the anxiety of Edward to
gain this last stronghold of the liberties of Scotland
was displayed, by his close and unremitting attendance
on the details of the siege. Though now
advanced in years, he is represented as exposing
himself with all the imprudent gallantry of
a youthful warrior; and on one or two occasions
he had nearly fallen a victim to his temerity.
While riding near the walls, a stone,
from one of the engines at work on the rampart,
struck the ground before him with so
much violence, that his horse backed, and fell
under him; and at another time, a javelin, thrown
by a soldier on the wall, struck him on the breast,
and stuck between the plates of his armour. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
point of the missile, however, had not pierced the
skin. Pulling it out with his hand, he shook it
in defiance, and loudly proclaimed that he would
hang the villain who had hit him. In the mean
time, the engines belonging to the castle were so
well managed, and the enormous stones which they
threw, so skilfully directed, that great numbers of
the besiegers were destroyed.</p>

<p>Edward now saw, that, without still greater efforts,
the place was not likely soon to capitulate.
He therefore wrote to London, and other towns in
England, ordering the most powerful engines to be
sent him, with supplies of javelins, quarrells, and other
missiles; and the lead was torn from the roof of
the Cathedral of St Andrew’s to furnish materials
for the siege. Thirteen engines of the largest size
were at last brought to bear upon the castle, one
of which, called by Langtoft “the <span class="locked">Ludgare,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> or
Lurdare of Strivelyn,” was of the most formidable
description. This “hidous engyn,” when put in
operation, made tremendous breaches in the walls,
which the besieged in vain attempted to repair;
and after many destructive sallies, and “fulle and
hard affrays,” and a siege unparalleled in the history
of the war&mdash;their provisions exhausted, and
their walls torn to pieces&mdash;Sir William Oliphant and
his brave little garrison were forced to surrender
at discretion. Every possible indignity which a tyrannical
mind destitute of generosity, and exasperated
by opposition, could inflict, was now heaped
upon the gallant defenders. They were compelled to
go in procession to the tent of Edward, and&mdash;denuded
of every garment save their shirts, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
heads and feet uncovered&mdash;on their bended knees,
with uplifted hands, had thus to implore his clemency;
upon which their <i>magnanimous</i> conqueror
condescended to spare their lives, and sent them to
expiate their offences in the dungeons of England.
The garrison, according to Langtoft, consisted of
Sir William Oliphant, Sir William Duplin, twenty
gentlemen of inferior degree, a preaching friar, a
monk, and thirteen “maydens and ladies.” The
common soldiers are said to have amounted to
140, whose names, it is to be regretted, have not
been preserved. The following are all that remain

<p>The proceedings of Edward at length gave umbrage
to Cumyn and Bruce. These chieftains,
after Baliol, had the nearest pretensions to the
crown, and they had both been amused by Edward
with hopes of the kingdom. In the destruction,
however, of the fortresses, and the alterations he had
made in the constitution of the country, they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
little that tended towards the fulfilment of the promises
he had made them. Cumyn, therefore, having
found an opportunity, broke the matter to
Bruce, by lamenting the state to which their country
was reduced by the power or policy of Edward,
who endeavoured to sow discord among those
whose interest it was to be friends; and by taking
advantage of the animosities he thus excited, furthered
his own ambitious and tyrannical designs.</p>

<p>These remarks begat the confidence of his rival,
who communicated without reserve the promises
that had been held out to him by Edward; which
drew from Cumyn a proposal for the delivery of
their country, in which he offered to give Bruce
his estates, on condition that he relinquished his
claim, and assisted him to gain the crown; or
to accept of Bruce’s estates on the same terms.
Bruce, who considered his claim to be better founded
than that of Cumyn, agreed to make over his
estates on attaining to the kingdom through the
assistance of Cumyn; and a private bond was entered
into between them for this <span class="locked">purpose.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
order to cover their intentions, Bruce agreed to
accompany Edward to London, and leave his brother,
Edward Bruce, to attend to his interest in
Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
The English monarch having now, as he thought,
completely depressed the spirit of the Scots, and
brought them effectually under his yoke, began
to make preparations for his return to England;
and with this view, he appointed Adomer de Valence
regent or viceroy of the kingdom, filling all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
places of trust with Englishmen, or such creatures
among the Scots as he found suitable to his purpose.
Having made these, and such other arrangements
as his policy suggested, he returned
home in triumph, firmly persuaded that he had
finally reduced the kingdom of Scotland to the
condition of a province of England.</p>

<p>Edward, however, had scarcely arrived in London,
before accounts from the North convinced him
of the uncertain nature of his conquest, so long as
Wallace remained at large in the country; and
as neither threats nor promises could subdue his
inflexible fidelity to the liberties of his native land,
large rewards were offered for securing his person,
dead or alive. Influenced by the great promises
held out to him, Ralph de <span class="locked">Haliburton,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the prisoners whom Edward had carried with him
into England, undertook the perfidious office, and
for that purpose was allowed to return to Scotland.
Of his after proceedings, we have, however,
but a very imperfect outline; and from all that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
can collect, his exertions in his villanous mission
appear to have been limited to one or two attempts;
in the last of which, from his knowledge
of Wallace and his retreats, he contrived to have
him beset by a strong body of cavalry, in a situation
where he had no way of escape, but by springing
his horse over a precipice. This he effected;
and his pursuers, drawing back with horror, left
him to pursue his retreat on foot, his gallant steed
having perished in the fearful enterprise.</p>

<p>After this, it is supposed that Haliburton, alarmed
for the consequence of his conduct, and
dreading the vengeance of his countrymen, returned
with precipitation to England.</p>

CROWN.&mdash;CONDUCT OF CUMYN TOWARDS BRUCE.&mdash;NOTICE OF
CUMYN.&mdash;TRADITION RESPECTING THE CLAN CUMYN.&mdash;NOTICE
OF KERLE.&mdash;WALLACE BETRAYED BY MENTEITH.</span></h2>

<p>The situation of Scotland, after the departure of
Edward, was such as well warranted the representation
that had been transmitted to England.
Though there had as yet been no open insurrection,
still there was that in the bearing of the people,
which betokened any thing but good will towards
the existing state of things. The national
sports and customs of the English, which it had
been attempted to introduce among them, were
shunned and disregarded by the oppressed and
scowling population; while those chiefs who had
formerly shown the greatest attachment to the
cause of independence, were seldom heard of, except
when discovered holding their conferences in
those sequestered retreats, where they considered
themselves secure from all, save the wandering
spies employed by the faithless part of their own
countrymen.</p>

<p>Wallace now saw that the state of the country
required a different remedy from that which had
hitherto been applied. Baliol, whom he had acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
as his righteous sovereign, though detained
a prisoner in England, had, through the
menaces of Edward, made over to that monarch
his right to the crown and kingdom of Scotland.
This act, in the opinion of Wallace, released him
from his allegiance to one who had all along acted a
part unworthy of his attachment; for, though he
admitted his right to <i>resign</i> the crown, yet he
could not recognise a right to <i>transfer</i> it to a
stranger, to the exclusion of the lawful heir; and
as Edward, the son of Baliol, was also the prisoner
and tool of the King of England, he naturally
fixed his attention on Bruce, as the person
best fitted, from his birth and talents, to infuse
that confidence in the people which necessarily
arises from the presence of a person invested with
lawful authority. Having found no difficulty in
impressing Sir Simon Frazer, and those other
chiefs who adhered to him, with the same sentiments,
a negociation was entered into with Edward
Bruce, for inviting his brother from England to
assume the crown; and it is also said, that a special
<span class="locked">herald<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> from Wallace and his confederates
found his way to Bruce in disguise, who appointed
to meet with our hero on a certain night on the
burrow-muir of Glasgow.</p>

<p>1305. In the meantime, Wallace and his friends
were active in organizing the insurrection, which
was to burst forth as soon as Bruce appeared among
them, and who was at the same time to have
been proclaimed king. How far Cumyn was consulted
on the occasion, by Wallace and his associates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
does not appear. From the very little intercourse
which seems to have subsisted between
them since the fatal battle of Falkirk, it is highly
probable that the accession of our patriot and his
party, to the proposal for placing Bruce on the
throne, was communicated to Cumyn through the
medium of Edward Bruce&mdash;the fiery temperament
of whose mind, was not always in unison with those
maxims of sound policy necessary for conducting
affairs of such moment. Whether Cumyn had
ever been sincere in the agreement entered into
with the Earl of Carrick, or whether he afterwards
repented of the bargain he had made, is a point
not easily to be ascertained; but with a duplicity
worthy of his conduct on a former occasion, he
is said to have despatched the bond between himself
and Bruce to Edward; urging, at the same
time, the arrestment of his rival, as necessary to
prevent the disturbance that was on the eve of
breaking out in Scotland.</p>

<p>It might be considered by our readers an omission,
were we to bring our labours to a close, without
embodying in our pages a more particular account
of this subtile and talented baron, than what
has hitherto appeared in the course of the narrative.
To obviate this objection, perhaps the following
brief outline, in addition to what has already
been stated, may suffice.</p>

<p>John Cumyn, or as he is called by the Gaël,
<i>Ian Ruadh Mhac Ian Ruadh Chiumein</i> (Red
John, the son of Red John Cumming), was Lord
of Badenoch, Lochaber, and other extensive districts,
and the head of the most potent clan that
ever existed in Scotland. His power was more
formidable than any of his fellow-competitors for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
the crown. Upwards of 60 belted knights and
their vassals were bound to follow his banner; and
the influence of the family was such, that during
the minority of Alexander III., after driving from
Scotland a strong faction, formed and supported
by the interest of England, the Cumyns and their
adherents negociated a treaty with Llewellyn, a
prince of Wales. In this instrument, John, the
father of the subject of the present notice, appears
as Justiciary of Galloway. This document is preserved
in Rymer’s Fœdera, vol. i. p. 653. Those,
however, who may not have access to that work,
may have their curiosity gratified, by referring to
Tytler’s History of Scotland, vol. i. p. 424.</p>

<p>It is uncertain at what time John Cumyn succeeded
to his father. He appears, however, in
1289, as joint agent along with James the Steward,
in the letter of the community of Scotland,
directed to Edward I., from Brigham. According
to Henry, he was married to a cousin of the King
of England; and this, from all authorities, seems to
have been the case, for he espoused Joan, the sister
of Aymer de Valence, whose father, William
de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, was uterine brother
to Henry III. With this powerful connection,
he no doubt expected a different decision in
the submission respecting the throne of Scotland.
This disappointment, in all probability, made him
afterwards more ready to join the insurrection
under Wallace; and if it had not been for the odium
which he afterwards drew upon himself by
his conduct at the battle of Falkirk, he might have
figured in the annals of his country with a fair and
honourable reputation. While regent of Scotland,
his behaviour was not only unexceptionable, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
often praiseworthy. This, however, may have been
partly owing to the strict surveillance which Wallace
still exercised in the affairs of the country,
or partly from a wish to conciliate his countrymen
in the event of a favourable opportunity occurring
for his obtaining the crown,&mdash;an object of ambition
of which it is pretty evident he never lost
sight.</p>

<p>The treachery towards Bruce, which has been
charged against him by all authorities except
Lord Hailes, also tended to deepen the stain on
his character. This charge, whether true or false,
we have no means of ascertaining. A number
of the objections stated by his Lordship against
it are, however, of considerable weight. That a
bond existed between them of the tenor already
described, there is little doubt; and that the terms
of this bond became afterwards matter of dispute,
there is some reason to believe, as the fulfilment
of it would have been dangerous to both. For
had Bruce been placed on the throne by the assistance
of Cumyn, and the latter had received the
estates of Bruce, according to agreement, he would
have been a subject far too powerful for the crown;
and <i>vice versa</i> in the case of Bruce. The quarrel,
therefore, which subsequently took place in the
chapel of Dumfries, and which ended in the
death of Cumyn, (the particulars of which are
known to every reader), might have arisen in an
altercation respecting the difficulties involved in
the completion of the bond, without either party
having been guilty of a breach of faith. It was no
doubt the policy of Bruce and his confederates, that
the stain of treachery should be affixed on the name
of Cumyn, as it afforded the only plausible excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
for committing a murder in a place of such reputed
sanctity. Indeed the circumstance of the latter
having requested an interview within the precincts
of a church, showed nothing like a premeditated intention
to quarrel; but since the deed was committed,
it seemed necessary to the future safety
and views of Bruce and his faction, that with
the influence the character of the Cumyns should
be diminished. That they assisted in this last object
themselves, is but too apparent; otherwise it
would be difficult to account for that odium which
afterwards became attached to them. For while
the Scots, in the Low country, cried out against
the “<span xml:lang="cel" lang="cel">fause Cumyn’s Kyn</span>,” their vassals in Badenoch
and Lochaber re-echoed the charge, till the
very name became cognominal with deceit; so much
so, that the following proverb is at this day remembered
in those parts of the Highlands to
which their influence extended:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" xml:lang="cel" lang="cel">
<span class="i0"><i>“Fhad’s a bhios crann an cóille,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bi’dh fóill an Cuimeineach.”</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>“While there are trees in a wood, there will be deceit
in a Cumyn.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We will not however assert, that the enmity of
the Gaël arose from the conduct of the Cumyns in
the Low country; for if we may credit tradition
still current in the West Highlands, this once
powerful and oppressive family gave sufficient
cause, in their own territorial bounds, for the antipathy
of their neighbours and vassals. The
atrocities which they committed in their castles of
Inverlochy, Badenoch, and other strongholds which
they polluted with their crimes, at last roused the
slumbering vengeance of the people; and tradition,
in her vague manner, dates the downfall of this potent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
clan, from the time of “Cumyn’s flight from
Onnich.” At what period this occurred, cannot
now be exactly ascertained; but with the particulars
of the story we shall close this imperfect <span class="locked">notice:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Cumyns, it seems, in the plenitude of their
power, paid little attention, when it suited their
wishes, to the abrogation of the infamous law of
Evenus, and the “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mercheta mulierum</i>” was generally
spurned, when the charms of the bride
happened to please the eye of the chief. It would
seem that three marriages were about to take place
at Onnich, a little town on the borders of Lochaber.
The women were beautiful, and the men spirited
and brave. The half-merk had been tendered at
the gates of Inverlochy, by the bridegrooms and
their friends, and the refusal of it by the chief gave
them reason to apprehend the fate that was intended
for them. The case excited deep interest.
The day of marriage approached, and brought
along with it the Lord of Badenoch and his two
sons, with their usual retinue. The half-merk
was again tendered, and refused. The men drew
their swords, determined to guard the purity of
their fair ones. A conflict ensued; friends gathered
to the assistance of the injured; the two sons of
Cumyn were killed; while he, with the remains of
his myrmidons, betook himself to flight. The country
arose and made after him, till the affair swelled
to a general insurrection. All his train were
sacrificed to the fury of the pursuers, many, no
doubt, having more serious grievances to revenge.
The flight continued till their obnoxious chief
reached a hill near the present site of Fort Augustus;&mdash;where,
overcome with fatigue, he was seen to
sit down apparently to rest himself. On coming up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
to him, however, they found that the wretched
man had already paid the forfeit of his crimes.
He was carried down and buried on the spot
where the fort now stands, which is still known
to old Highlanders by the name of “<i xml:lang="cel" lang="cel">Cill Chiumein</i>,”
or the burial-place of Cumyn; and the hill
on which he died retains to this day the appellation
of “<i xml:lang="cel" lang="cel">Suidh Chiumein</i>,” or Cumyn’s Seat.
Very few of the clan are now to be found in
these districts.</p>

<p>To return to our narrative: Wallace, who, as
he conceived, among other friends, had secured
the co-operation of Sir John Menteith to the measures
then in agitation, for the purpose, it is supposed,
of giving as early notice as possible of the
arrival of Bruce, had retained near his person a
young man related to <span class="locked">Menteith,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> who was to have
been despatched with the news to Dumbarton, as
soon as their future monarch should arrive, when
that important fortress was to have declared in his
favour.</p>

<p>Confiding in the arrangements thus made, Wallace,
as the time appointed by Bruce drew near,
collected his followers round Glasgow, and disposed
of them in such a manner, as to be able to bring
them together on the shortest <span class="locked">notice,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> For the
better concealment of his design, he retired to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
small lonely house at Robroyston, about three
miles north-west of Glasgow. Here he waited
with impatience for the night on which Bruce had
appointed to meet him, little dreaming of the danger
to which his intended sovereign was exposed,
through the conduct of Cumyn, nor of the treachery
that was hatching against himself.</p>

<p>The means which were employed to accomplish
the destruction of Bruce, would have been
of very little avail towards securing the objects intended,
so long as his brother and our hero&mdash;who
had now identified himself with the interest of the
Brucian party&mdash;remained to head the insurrection
that was expected to break out; and as all the
magnificent promises of Edward had been unable
to subdue the stern virtue of the patriot, his emissaries
now bethought themselves of assailing the fidelity
of those friends in whom he seemed chiefly
to confide. Unfortunately for the cause of liberty,
their allurements were but too successful; and the
honour of his early friend, Sir John Menteith, gave
way to the arts of the tempter.</p>

<p>On the night of the 5th of August 1305, Sir
William, and his faithful friend Kerlé,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
by the youth before mentioned, had betaken themselves
to their lonely retreat at <span class="locked">Robroyston;<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span> to
which place their steps had been watched by a
spy, who, as soon as he had observed them enter,
returned to his employers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
At the dead hour of midnight, while the two
friends lay fast asleep, the youth, whose turn it
was to watch, cautiously removed the bugie from
the neck of Wallace, and conveyed it, along with
his arms, through an aperture in the wall; then
slowly opening the door, two men-at-arms silently
entered, and, seizing upon Kerlé, hurried him
from the apartment, and instantly put him to
death. Wallace, awakened by the noise, started
to his feet, and, missing his weapons, became sensible
of his danger, but grasping a large piece of
oak, which had been used for a seat, he struck two of
his assailants dead on the spot, and drove the rest
headlong before him. Seeing the fury to which
he was roused, and the difficulty they would have
in taking him alive, Menteith now advanced,
to the aperture, and represented to him the
folly of resistance, as the English, he said, having
heard of his place of resort, and of the plans he
had in contemplation, were collected in too large
a force to be withstood; that if he would accompany
him a prisoner to Dumbarton, he would
undertake for the safety of his person;&mdash;that all
the English wished, was to secure the peace of the
country, and to be free from his molestation;&mdash;adding,
that if he consented to go with him, he
should live in his own house in the castle, and he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>Menteith, alone should be his keeper;&mdash;that even
now, he would willingly sacrifice his life in his defence;
but that his attendants were too few, and
too ill-appointed, to have any chance of success
in contending with the English. He concluded
by assuring Wallace, that he had followed in order
to use his influence with his enemies in his behalf,
and that they had listened to him on condition of
an immediate surrender; but that if he did not instantly
comply, the house would soon be in flames
about him. These, and other arguments, were
urged with all the seeming sincerity of friendship;
and our patriot, confiding in early recollections, and
the private understanding that subsisted between
them, allowed himself to be conducted to Dumbarton
Castle.</p>

<p>On the morrow, however, no Monteith appeared
to exert his <i>influence</i>, in order to prevent the
unfortunate hero from being carried from the fortress;
and strongly fettered, and guarded by a
powerful escort, under the command of Robert de
Clifford and Aymer de Vallance, he was hurried to
the South, by the line of road least exposed to
the chance of a rescue.</p>

<h2 title="CHAPTER XII"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="subhead">TRIAL, EXECUTION, AND CHARACTER OF WALLACE.</span></h2>

<p>As the capture of Wallace was an event wholly
unexpected by the English, the news of it, which
spread with the rapidity of lightning, produced, in
every part of the kingdom, a deep and universal
sensation. Labour of every kind was abandoned,
and people of all ranks flocked to those points of
the road where it was expected the illustrious
captive would pass. At Carlisle the escort halted
for a night; and the tower in which he was secured,
long afterwards retained his name. As the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> approached London, the crowds became
more numerous; and, on entering the capital, his
conductors found their progress retarded by the
multitudes that were collected;&mdash;while every elevation
or projection, however perilous, from which
he could be seen, was occupied with, or clung to,
by anxious spectators, eager to behold a man who
had filled England with terror, and the fame of
whose achievements had resounded through every
country in Europe. After much exertion, the
cavalcade at length reached the house of William
Delect, a citizen in Fenchurch Street, where their
prisoner was lodged for the night. From the circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of his having been taken to a private
house, rather than to a place of greater security,
it has been imagined by some, that Edward intended
to make a last effort to gain Wallace over to
his interest. This conjecture, however, is not sufficiently
supported by subsequent proceedings, to
entitle it to any degree of credit; and we are
more inclined to believe, that the difficulty which
the party encountered in making their way through
the dense multitudes who had blocked up the
streets and lanes leading to the Tower, may, with
greater probability, be assigned as the cause for
taking him to the house of Delect.</p>

<p>The thirst for revenge existed too keenly in the
ruthless mind of Edward, to admit of much delay
in the sacrifice of his victim. Though a consideration
for the opinion of the more enlightened of his subjects,
and the manner in which his conduct might
be viewed at foreign courts, obliged him to have
recourse at least to the formality of a trial&mdash;the
indecent haste with which it was brought on,
made the mockery of judicial procedure but too
apparent. The day after his arrival, he was conducted
on horseback, from the house which his
brief residence had made the scene of universal
attraction, to take his trial in Westminster Hall.
His progress from Fenchurch Street, according to
Stowe, appears to have been a sort of procession,
Lord John de Segrave, the fugitive of Roslin,
acting as Grand Marshal of England, and armed
cap-à-pè, rode on one side, while Geoffrey de
Hartlepool, Recorder of London, equipped in a
similar manner, rode on the other. The Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen followed, attended by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
number of official characters on horseback and on
foot, arranged according to their respective <span class="locked">grades.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching the spot where the solemn farce
was to be performed, he was placed on the south
bench of the great hall; and, in consequence of
an absurd <span class="locked">report,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> which had been circulated in
England, of his having said that he deserved to
wear a crown in that place, a crown of laurel was
put upon his head. The noble appearance of the
man, joined to his calm and unruffled demeanour,
entirely disarmed this silly attempt at ridicule of
its intended <span class="locked">effect.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Sir Peter Malory, the King’s Justice, then rose,
and read the indictment, wherein the prisoner was
charged with treason against the King of England,
burning of towns, and slaying of the subjects of
his Majesty. To the first of these counts Wallace
answered, that, as he had never been the subject
of the King of England, he owed him no allegiance,
and consequently could be no traitor. As
to the other offences, he frankly admitted, that, in
the discharge of his duty to his country, he had
done all that was stated. On this admission, the
following atrocious sentence was <span class="locked">pronounced:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>For treason, he was to be first dragged to the
place of execution. For murder and robbery, he
was to be then hung a certain time by the neck;
and, because he had burned abbeys and religious
houses, he was to be taken down alive from the
gibbet, his entrails torn out, and burnt before
him, his body to be quartered, and the parts afterwards
to be disposed of as the clemency of Majesty
might <span class="locked">suggest.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span></p>

<p>When the necessary preparations were made for
carrying this sentence into execution, the late
champion of Scottish independence was brought
forth from the place where he had been kept in
confinement, heavily ironed, and chained to a bench
of oak. He was then placed on a hurdle, and, surrounded
by a strong guard of soldiers, ignominiously
dragged to the Elms, in Smithfield. That
self-possession and undaunted demeanour which
he evinced during the trial, appeared equally conspicuous
on the scaffold. Looking round with undisturbed
composure on the assembled multitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
he addressed himself to a person near him, and
asked for a priest to whom he might make confession.
This request, on being made known to Edward,
he is said to have sternly refused; and the
rancorous old man forbad <i>any clergyman to retard
the execution</i> for such a purpose. On hearing this
undignified command of his sovereign, Winchelsea,
Archbishop of Canterbury, the same individual
who so faithfully discharged his duty at Carlaverock,
stepped boldly forward, and, after earnestly
remonstrating with Edward, declared his
determination to officiate himself. When the ceremony
usual on such occasions was finished, Wallace
rose from his knees, and the Archbishop
having taken leave of him, instantly departed for
Westminster, thus declining to witness the sequel
of an act so revolting to humanity, and which he
no doubt considered as fixing a deep stain on the
character of his country.</p>

<p>The spectacle which was now exhibited to the
gaze of the inhabitants of the metropolis of England,
was such as perhaps has never before been presented
to the populace of any land. The <i><span class="smcap smaller">LAST FREEMAN</span></i>
of an <span class="smcap smaller">ANCIENT PEOPLE</span>, not less renowned for
their bravery, than for their love of independence,
stood a calm and unshrinking victim, ready to be
immolated at the shrine of despotism. That powerful
arm which had long contended for liberty was
now to be unstrung beneath the knife of the executioner;
and that heart, replete with every ennobling
virtue, which never quailed in the sternest
hour of danger, was doomed to quiver in the purifying
flames of martyrdom.</p>

<p>During the pause which preceded the unhallowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
operations, Wallace turned to Lord Clifford,
and requested that a <span class="locked">Psalter,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span> which had been
taken from his person, might be returned. His
desire being complied with, he asked a priest to
hold it open before him. This book had been his
constant companion from his early years, and was
perhaps the gift of his mother or his uncle, the
parson of Dunipace.</p>

<p>After hanging for a certain time, the sufferer
was taken down, while yet in an evident state of
sensibility. He was then disembowelled; and the
heart, wrung from its place, was committed to the
flames in his presence. During this dreadful process,
his eyes still continued to linger on the
Psalter, till, overpowered by his sufferings, he expired
among their hands with all that passive heroism
which may be supposed to belong to so
elevated a character. The body was afterwards
dismembered; the head fixed on London bridge,
the right arm on the bridge of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
the left at Berwick, the right leg at Perth,
and the left at Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Thus fell this great and exemplary patriot, a
martyr to the rights and independence of his country,
than whom, if we consider his extraordinary
personal and mental endowments,&mdash;joined to his
inextinguishable and disinterested love of liberty, a
greater hero is not to be found in the annals of
any people. Born to a slender inheritance, and
unconnected by birth with the opulent families of
his country, he derived no advantage from those
circumstances which often assisted other distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
characters in attaining that place in the
temple of fame to which their ambition was directed.
To his own genius he was indebted for
a system of tactics eminently calculated for the
contest he had in view; and with his own arm he
gave the first impulse to the cause of freedom,
which afterwards, on the field of Bannockburn, was
crowned with such glorious and decisive success
under a kindred spirit&mdash;on whom the inspiring
mantle of our patriot descended, as he winged his
flight to the regions of immortality.</p>

<p>In person, Wallace was admirably fitted to grace
that elevated station among mankind, for which
his genius and talents so eminently qualified him.
His visage was long, well proportioned, and exquisitely
beautiful; his eyes were bright and piercing;
the hair of his head and beard auburn, and inclined
to curl: that on his brows and eye-lashes was of
a lighter shade; his lips were round and full. Under
the chin, on the left side, was a <span class="locked">scar,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> the only
one visible, although many were to be found on
his <span class="locked">person;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> his stature was lofty and majestic, rising
the head and shoulders above the tallest men
in the country. Yet his form, though gigantic,
possessed the most perfect symmetry; and with a
degree of strength almost incredible, there was
combined such an agility of body and fleetness in
running, that no one, except when mounted on
horseback, could outstrip, or escape from him,
when he happened to pursue. All-powerful as a
swordsman, and unrivalled as an archer, his blows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
were fatal, and his shafts unerring: as an equestrian,
he was a model of dexterity and grace; while
the hardships he experienced in his youth, made
him view with indifference the severest privations
incident to a military life. In common intercourse,
his accents were mild, and his manners grave and
urbane. In the field, when addressing his soldiers,
his discourse was brief and animating, and the
sound of his voice thrilled through their hearts like
the spirit-stirring notes of the <span class="locked">clarion.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> Great
and varied, however, as were the accomplishments
nature had lavished on his person, the graces with
which she had enriched his mind threw a radiance
over all the rest of her gifts. Untaught himself in
the military art, he became the instructor of his
countrymen, and his first efforts were worthy of
the greatest captain of the age.</p>

<p>If we may judge from his regard to the sanctity
of an oath, his ideas of morality appear to have
been much at variance with the corrupt practice of
the age. Uncontaminated by the pernicious example
of the great men of the country, he rather
chose to bear hunger and every other privation
the unsheltered outlaw might be exposed to, than
purchase the advantage so much prized by others,
at the expense of taking an oath he had no intention
of holding sacred:&mdash;still, this inflexible rectitude
of soul could not shame the aristocracy from
their convenient perjuries; for the bands by which
he strove to unite them together, became like ropes
of sand in the hour of trial. Notwithstanding,
however, all the difficulties that were thrown in
his way, the vigour of his own character, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
wisdom of his measures, enabled him to achieve the
deliverance of his native land. To the charges of
ambition and usurpation that were brought against
him, he gave the noblest refutation, by resigning
the bauble of power into the hands of those little
spirits, who would otherwise have betrayed the
cause of national independence, or involved their
country in all the horrors of civil war. Thus, his
virtuous self-denial preserved the people whom his
valour had set free.</p>

<p>In the biographical notices that have been submitted,
the reader will perceive the formidable array
of talent and power with which Wallace had
to contend. To an aristocracy, at that time perhaps
unrivalled in Europe, and headed by a monarch
as distinguished for ambition, sternness of
purpose, and warlike propensities, as he was notorious
for the absence of those virtues which constitute
the redeeming traits in the character of a soldier&mdash;the
magnanimous patriot had at first little
to oppose, save the innate energies of his own invincible
heart, and the resources of a genius which
Heaven seems peculiarly to have fitted for the task.
That Scotland, distracted by faction, and deprived
of all foreign aid, should, under the guidance of
one who ranked among the humblest of her nobles,
have again advanced herself to the dignity of
an independent state, in defiance of the power of
England, backed by the resources of Ireland
and Wales, was considered by her adversaries
as too humiliating to their national character to
admit of their relinquishing the <span class="locked">contest.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> The renewal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
of every invasion was, however, met by
an increasing stubbornness of opposition; and the
chivalrous conqueror in Palestine, the “high-souled”
Plantagenet, at last condescended to <i>steal</i> away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the enemy he could neither bribe nor subdue, and
thus purchase the brief and delusive semblance of
a victory, at the price of everlasting dishonour.</p>

<p>The mind of Wallace was imbued with the most
exalted ideas of independence; and the stern and
inflexible spirit with which he guarded his own
and his country’s honour, could only be equalled
by the scrupulous delicacy he exercised towards
the feelings of others. Loving freedom for her
own sake, he considered her sanctuary, wherever
placed, as too sacred to be violated. Among the
many proofs of this elevation of mind, the following
may be mentioned:&mdash;On the surrender of de
Longueville, the high-spirited Frenchman was anxious
to know the name and the character of his
conqueror. On the name of Wallace being announced
to him, he fell on his knees, and thanked
God that so worthy an enemy had been his victor;
and, according to the custom of the age, he
tendered his service, along with his sword. “Service
from you, Sir Thomas,” said the gallant Scot,
with an accent of kind familiarity, “I cannot accept;
your friendship is what I desire.” On another
occasion, in the heat of an engagement, having,
as he conceived, given orders to Sir John
Graham in a manner too peremptory&mdash;after the
victory had been secured, he came up to his
brave friend, and surprised him with a humble
apology for any thing like harshness he might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
displayed in his manner of expressing himself.
Graham, however, was quite unconscious of hearing
any thing that he had reason to take amiss;
and expressed a hope that he would always act
towards him and others in the same manner, when
the interest of their country was at stake.</p>

<p>In the division of spoil, the portion that fell
to the share of Wallace he set apart as a fund
from which those were rewarded who had distinguished
themselves by their valour or good conduct,
while contending for the liberty of their
country&mdash;thus stimulating their efforts in their own
cause, by the sacrifice of his personal advantage.
The delicacy, also, which he evinced, in excluding
his relations from any participation in those grants
and emoluments with which he rewarded the services
of others, showed him exempt from any selfish
or mercenary feeling, and decidedly averse to the
aggrandizement of his <span class="locked">family<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> at the national expense.
In those times, when driven to the woods
and natural fastnesses of the country, where his
little party were exposed, from the scarcity of
provisions, to the greatest distress, the expedients
he had recourse to for their relief, and the self-denial
he exercised in order to husband the slender
supplies for their use, impressed his followers with
sentiments of admiration and gratitude. The system
which he introduced, during the short period
of his regency, of disciplining and subdividing the
nation, evinced the clear and comprehensive views
he entertained of the true interests of the country;
and had his successors in power followed up the
same measure, it would doubtless have been productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
of incalculable benefit to the kingdom; as,
independent of the great force the Legislature might
thus have been enabled to bring into the field in
cases of emergency, it would have undermined,
and eventually overthrown, the feudal superiority
of the barons, and those petty confederations among
clans, which have been for so many ages the
bane and curse of Scotland. His views, however,
for the immediate and permanent prosperity of the
country, took even a more extensive range than
what is embraced by the above wise and salutary
measure. Aware of the benefit which Scotland had
formerly derived from her commercial intercourse
with the Continent, we find his attention, within
a month after the battle of Stirling, seriously turned
towards the re-establishment of this important
object; and while the nation was mustering at Roslin
for the invasion of England, her leader was actively
engaged in despatching intimation to the
different Hanse-towns, that the ports of Scotland
were again open to the trade of all friendly <span class="locked">powers.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span>
The plan which he pursued in his invasions, was
the most efficient for exhausting the enemy’s country,
enriching his own, and encouraging his countrymen
to flock to his standard. Though often severe
in his retaliations, yet, towards women and
children, he always exercised the greatest humanity.</p>

<p>During his Guardianship, the country was beginning
to feel the return of her former prosperity.
With the spoil of the enemy he had diffused plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
over the land; the poor were protected; thieves
were promptly and severely punished; cheats and
liars were discouraged; and good men met the reward
of their virtues. The vigilance with which
he watched over the public weal was unremitting,
and never for a moment gave place to any object
of personal consideration. Even those duties which
are often considered paramount to every other,
were with him secondary to the interest of his
country; for, on the death of his mother, his
presence being required elsewhere, he intrusted
the performance of her obsequies to his friend
John Blair and a confidential servant;&mdash;which duty
they discharged with becoming solemnity in the
cathedral of Dunfermline. To this cemetery, it
is conjectured, the fragments of his own body
were secretly collated by his companions, after the
barbarous and impolitic exposure had taken place.
At his execution, that self-command and nobleness
of soul, which formed such luminous traits in
his character, never for a moment forsook him.
Without deigning to breathe a murmur, either at
the injustice of the tyrant who condemned, or the
unhappy man who betrayed <span class="locked">him,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> he submitted
to his fate with that becoming dignity which extorted
even from his enemies expressions of unqualified
admiration.</p>

<p>A revulsion, the natural consequence of the inhuman
cruelty of Edward, and the undaunted demeanour
of his victim, took place in the minds of
the people of England immediately after his execution;
and the story of an <span class="locked">English<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> monk who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
pretended to have seen a vision of angels conducting
Wallace out of purgatory with much honour,
was quickly circulated, and received with pleasure,
all over Britain.</p>

<p>The following lines, translated from the original
Latin by Hume of Godscroft, are understood to
have been composed some time after the execution
of our illustrious patriot, by his afflicted friend
and chaplain John Blair; and with this elegant
and pathetic tribute of genius at the shrine of
departed greatness, we shall close the present

<span class="subhead">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>The wisdom of the ancient Egyptians has been
much celebrated, but in no respect does it appear
more conspicuous than in the uses to which they
applied the historical records of their country. By
their laws, the hand which kept a faithful transcript
of passing events, and registered with strict
impartiality the transactions and characters of their
kings, was removed from the knowledge and influence
of those whose deeds were thus related.
On the accession of every new monarch, it was
part of the ceremonial to read in his presence the
records of his predecessor’s reign. By this means
he was apprised of the faults he ought to avoid,
and admonished of the virtues it was incumbent on
him to emulate; while the reflection arising from
the certainty that after death his name also would
be consigned over to posterity&mdash;either to receive
the meed of grateful remembrance, or the impress
of merited reprobation, according to his actions&mdash;operated
on the royal mind as a useful and salutary
restraint.</p>

<p>Other nations aspired to imitate the Egyptians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
but national imitation is too often like that among
individuals. The faults and blemishes of the original
are more readily caught than its beauties and
perfections. Thus, while the grossness of Egypt’s
mythology was most servilely copied, <i>one</i> practice
which gave dignity and utility to her history was
entirely overlooked, and the pen of the historian,
in place of being wielded by the impartial, fearless,
and untrammelled friend of public virtue, was
more frequently found in the hand of the needy
parasite; employed in the base and degrading occupation
of varnishing the enormities of the ermined
tyrant, whose ambitious progress to distinction
had been marked by the subversion of the
rights, and the carnage of his fellow-men. This
prostitution of the historic muse is not unknown
among modern authors, and may be often attributed
to an unworthy desire of administering to
the feelings of a favourite party, or a wish to conciliate
the national prejudices of their readers.
Though compelled, by the general increase of
knowledge, to give a more faithful narrative of
facts than the writers of antiquity, when it may
suit any of the purposes that have been mentioned,
the subject of their biography is seldom
dismissed without being made to undergo a sort
of purgation in the general estimate of his character,
and which is often found to be at antipodes
to the actions with which it stands connected.
Perhaps the annals of England cannot afford
a more striking instance of this perversion of all
that is valuable in historical literature, than in the
portraits which some historians have drawn of Edward
I.</p>

<p>Without attempting to delineate the character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
this ambitious disturber of the peace of Britain, the
writer will merely notice a few of the leading circumstances
of his history, and leave the reader to
discover by what curious process of literary chemistry
those crudities have been made to harmonize,
in order to produce so fair a display of political
sagacity and kingly greatness.</p>

<p>The littleness which appears to have been inherent
in the mind of Edward was laid open to
the Londoners in 1263, by his breaking into the
treasury of the Knights Templars, and carrying off
1000<i>l.</i> deposited there by the citizens. This robbery
was looked upon by the people as an act so
thoroughly base, that they instantly flew to arms,
and assaulted the houses of those among the nobility
who were supposed accessary to the theft.
Edward was at this time in his 26th year; of
course youthful indiscretion cannot be advanced
as an excuse for the crime.</p>

<p>His aggression upon Scotland has been indulgently
placed to the account of those enlightened
and statesman-like views which he entertained of
the true interests and general welfare of Britain,
and the advantages he discovered would result
from the resources of the two countries being consolidated
under one head. This “reason of state,”
has been held up in extenuation of the nefarious
means which he resorted to for the accomplishment
of his purpose. But by the extracts which
we are about to make from the pages of an author
every way inclined to treat the faults of Edward
with lenity, the reader will perceive, that though
the enlightened views “which he took of the solid
interests of his kingdom,” may have found a
place in the imagination of the historian, they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
not appear to have occurred to the monarch. The
extinction of every thing like rational liberty, and
the establishment of an extensive and uncontrollable
autocracy, seem to have been the undisguised
objects of his ambition. In proof of which,
we have only to refer to his demeanour towards
his barons, and the unwarrantable appropriation of
the effects of his subjects, mentioned in the extracts
alluded to. His conduct in respect to Scotland
being thus stripped of the only palliation that can
be offered, it stands forward on the page of history
in all its native deformity, unrelieved by one
solitary extenuating circumstance, while the following
transaction gives it, if possible, a darker and
more disgusting complexion.</p>

<p>In 1267, Henry and Prince Edward, being
driven to the greatest extremity by the Earl of
Gloucester and other Barons, whom their oppressions
and unlawful exactions had forced to take
up arms, when every hope failed them, and even
the Tower of London was besieged by a numerous
army of enraged assailants, they were very
opportunely relieved from their perilous situation
by the assistance of 30,000 Scots, whom Alexander
sent to their relief; and with these auxiliaries they
were enabled to withstand, and afterwards to subdue,
their exasperated and refractory subjects.
The debt of gratitude which was thus incurred,
Edward had not an opportunity of discharging,
till after the death of Alexander, when the Scots,
with a generous confidence, which their own conduct
naturally inspired, applied to him to act as
umpire in settling the succession to the crown.
How honourably he acquitted himself in the discharge
of the duties of the trust thus reposed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
him, and how generous was the return he made
for their good offices, the reader requires not to
be told. Two nations, who had for nearly a century
regarded each other with feelings of mutual
good-will, and had lived in a state of friendly intercourse
highly beneficial to both, were suddenly
transformed into the most inveterate enemies; and
an implacable spirit of animosity engendered between
them, which it required the slow revolution
of ages to soften and obliterate. The guilty ambition
of this short-sighted tyrant entailed upon
the British states a quarrel the most bloody, the
most expensive, and the most insane that perhaps
ever existed between two nations. By the ridiculous
pretensions of the one, the improvement of
both countries was retarded, and their frontier
populations demoralized into cut-throats or plunderers,
who wandered in search of their prey over
a land barren as the desert, which might otherwise
have been teeming with the fruits of honest and
profitable industry.</p>

<p>Edward’s ideas of honesty we have already seen
in the affair of the Templars, and his feelings of
gratitude in his conduct towards the Scots. His
sense of justice may be gathered from his proceedings
against the Jews. The silver pennies of
the realm having been clipped, the offence was
traced to some of that unfortunate people, and in
one day 280 of both sexes were executed in London,
besides a great many more in different parts
of the kingdom, where it seems simultaneous measures
had been taken against them. That this
crime was confined entirely to the Jews, is not
likely. The implements by which it could be
committed were certainly not beyond the reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
English intellect; nor could the latter be supposed,
in every instance, superior to the temptation
which the gains presented. That the guilt of all
who suffered was ascertained, is impossible; and a
wholesale butchery of this kind, authorized by law,
as it could not answer the ends of justice, can only
be considered as gratuitously administering to the
worst of human passions.</p>

<p>The estimation in which Edward held those arts
which are calculated to instruct, refine, and elevate
the human mind, may be learned from his
treatment of the Minstrels of Wales. The remorseless
and sanguinary policy which suggested
that unhallowed act, could only have found place
in the breast where every virtuous and honourable
feeling had disappeared before the withering influence
of a selfish and detestable ambition. In
an age when the Minstrel’s profession was a passport
to the presence and protection of the great,
and the persons of those who exercised the calling
were held sacred even among tribes the least removed
from barbarism, the mind must have reached
a fearful state of depravity, that could break
through those barriers with which the gratitude
and veneration of mankind had surrounded the
children of genius, and thus immolate at the shrine
of an heartless despotism, the innocent and meritorious
depositories of a nation’s lore.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The reader may form some idea of the treasures
squandered by Edward in the Scottish wars, from
the Statement of Receipts and Disbursements for
the year 1300, inserted in Appendix M, at the end
of this volume. The military operations of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
year were not on a more expensive scale than those
connected with the preceding and subsequent invasions;
and by this statement, it will be found,
that the disbursements for the campaign of 1300,
exceeded, “within one department of the national
expenditure,” <i>one fifth</i> of the national
income. That the expenses of this campaign
pressed equally hard on other departments of the
exchequer, is sufficiently obvious from the singular
expedients which were resorted to for the purpose
of carrying it on. The year 1300 is remarkable
for the first attempt to depreciate the currency of
the realm, it having been then ordered that 243
pennies should be coined out of the pound of silver,
in place of 240 as formerly. In this year,
also, as will be seen by the statements already alluded
to, the Wardrobe department was in arrears
to the amount of 5949<i>l.</i> 4s. 3d., which circumstance&mdash;taken
in connexion with the fact, that Sir
Simon Fraser and other knights soon after deserted
the English service, because their pay and other
allowances were withheld&mdash;proves that the treasury
of England at this time must have been in a
very depressed state. This profitless expenditure
was continued with little interruption, from 1296
till 1320, in pursuit of an object, which, happily
for the future prosperity of both countries, was
unattainable.</p>

<p>We have already alluded to the treacherous
designs of Edward, regarding the liberties of his
own subjects; and, in illustration of the opinion
then expressed, we shall now subjoin the account
of his behaviour, after his triumphant return from
the north, as it appears in the pages of Dr Lingard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
an author who certainly cannot be considered as
a friend to Scotland:&mdash;we wish we were able to
call him a <i>candid</i> adversary.</p>

<p>“Had Edward,” says this learned, though often
disingenuous writer, “confined his rapacity to
the clergy, he might perhaps have continued to
despise their remonstrances; but the aids which
he had annually raised on the freeholders, the tallages
which he so frequently demanded of the cities
and boroughs, and the additional duties which
he extorted from the merchants, had excited a general
spirit of discontent. Wool and hides were
the two great articles of commerce; the exportation
of which was allowed only to foreign merchants,
and confined, by law, to eleven ports in
England, and three in Ireland. In the beginning
of his reign, the duty had been raised to half a
mark on each sack of wool; but the royal wants
perpetually increased; and, during his quarrel with
the King of France, he required five marks for
every sack of fine, three for every sack of coarse
wool, and five for every last of hides. On one
occasion, he extorted from the merchants a loan
of the value of all the wool which they exported;
on two others, he seized and sold both wool and
hides for his own profit. He even stretched his
rapacious hands to the produce of the soil, and the
live-stock of his subjects; and, to provision his
army in Guienne, he issued precepts to each sheriff
to collect, by assessment on the landholders of his
county, a certain number of cattle, and two thousand
quarters of wheat. Though this requisition
was accompanied with a promise of future payment,
the patience of the nation was exhausted:
Consultations began to be held: and preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
were made for resistance. Edward had assembled
two bodies of troops, with one of which he intended
to sail for Flanders, the other he destined
to reinforce the army in Guienne, (1297, Feb. 24.)
At Salisbury, he gave the command of the latter
to Bohun Earl of Hereford, the constable, and
to Bigod Earl of Norfolk, the mareschal of England;
but both these noblemen refused the appointment,
on the alleged ground, that, by their
office, they were bound only to attend on the
King’s person. Edward, in a paroxysm of rage,
addressing himself to the mareschal, exclaimed&mdash;‘By
the everlasting God, Sir Earl, you shall go
or hang.’&mdash;‘By the everlasting God, Sir King,’
replied Bigod, ‘I will neither go nor hang.’ Hereford
and Norfolk immediately departed: they
were followed by thirty bannerets, and fifteen hundred
knights; and the royal officers, intimidated
by their menaces, ceased to levy the purveyance.
Edward saw that it was necessary to dissemble,
and summoned some,&mdash;requested others, of his military
tenants to meet him in arms in London.</p>

<p>“The two Earls, in concert with the Archbishop
of Canterbury, had arranged their plan
of resistance to the royal exactions. On the appointed
day the constable and John de Segrave,
as deputy-mareschal, (Bigod himself was detained
at home by sickness) attended the King’s court;
but when they were required to perform their respective
duties (July 8th), they returned a refusal
in writing, on the ground that they had not received
a legal summons, but only a general invitation.
Edward appointed a new constable and mareschal;
and, to divide and weaken his opponents, sought
to appease the clergy, and to move the commiseration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
of the people (July 11th). He received
the primate with kindness, ordered the restoration
of his lands, and named him one of
the council to Prince Edward, whom he had
appointed regent. On a platform before the
entrance of Westminster Hall, accompanied by his
son, the Archbishop, and the Earl of Warwick, he
harangued the people, (July 14.) He owned
that the burdens which he had laid on them were
heavy; but protested that it had not been less
painful to him to impose, than it had been to them
to bear them. Necessity was his only apology.
His object had been to preserve himself and his
liege men from the cruelty and rapacity of the
Welsh, the Scots, and the French, who not only
sought <i>his</i> crown, but also thirsted after <i>their</i> blood.
In such case, it was better to sacrifice a part than
to lose the whole. ‘Behold,’ he concluded, ‘I
am going to expose myself to danger for you. If
I return, receive me again, and I will make you
amends; if I fall, here is my son; place him on
the throne, and his gratitude shall reward your
fidelity.’ At these words the King burst into
tears; the Archbishop was equally affected; the
contagion ran through the multitude; and shouts
of loyalty and approbation persuaded Edward that
he might still depend on the allegiance of his people.
This exhibition was followed by writs to
the sheriffs, ordering them to protect the clergy
from injury, and to maintain them in the possession
of their lands.</p>

<p>“He now ventured to proceed as far as Winchelsey
on his way to Flanders. But here he was
alarmed by reports of the designs of his opponents,
and ordered letters to be sent to every county,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
stating the origin of his quarrel with the two earls,
asserting that he had never refused any petition
for redress, and promising to confirm the charter
of liberties and charter of the forests, in return for
the liberal aid of an eighth which had been granted
by the council in London. Soon afterwards a paper
was put into his hands, purporting to be the
remonstrance of the archbishops, bishops, abbots,
and priors, the earls, barons, and whole commonalty
of England. In it they complained that the
last summons had been worded ambiguously; that
it called on them to accompany the King to
Flanders, a country in which they were not bound
to serve by the custom of their tenures; that even
if they were, they had been so impoverished by
aids, tallages, and unlawful seizures, as to be unable
to bear the expense; that the liberties granted
to them by the two charters had been repeatedly
violated; that the ‘evil toll’ (the duty) annually on
wool amounted alone to one-fifth of the whole income
of the land; and that, to undertake an expedition
to Flanders in the existing circumstances, was imprudent,
since it would expose the kingdom without
protection to the inroads of the Welsh and
Scots. Edward replied, that he could return no
answer on matters of such high importance, without
the advice of his council, a part of which had
already sailed for Flanders; that if the remonstrants
would accompany him, he would accept it
as a favour; if they refused, he trusted they would
raise no disturbance during his absence, (Aug. 19.)
Before his departure he appointed commissioners
in each county with powers to require security
from all persons for the payment of aids due to
the crown, and to imprison the publishers of false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
reports, the disturbers of the peace, and such of
the clergy as might presume to pronounce censures
against the royal officers for the discharge of their
duty.</p>

<p>“At length the King set sail, accompanied by
the barons and knights who had espoused his
cause; and two days later, Bohun and Bigod,
with a numerous retinue, proceeded to the exchequer.
The constable, in the presence of the
treasurer and judges, complained of the King’s
extortions, of his illegal seizures of private property,
and of the enormous duty imposed upon
wool; and forbade them, in the name of the baronage
of England, to levy the last eight which had
been granted by the great council, because it had
been voted without his knowledge and concurrence,
and that of his friends. From the exchequer
they rode to the Guildhall, where they called upon
the citizens to join in the common cause, and to
aid in wresting the confirmation of the national
liberties from a reluctant and despotic sovereign.
The tears which the Londoners had shed during
Edward’s harangue, were now dried up; considerations
of interest suppressed the impulse of pity;
and they gave assurances of their co-operation to
the barons, who immediately retired to their respective
counties. Both during their progress to
the capital, and their return from it, they had
marched in military array. But at the same time
they had been careful to preserve the peace; and
had threatened, by proclamation, to punish every
lawless aggressor with immediate amputation of a
hand, or the loss of the head, according to the
quality of the offence.</p>

<p>“The King was soon informed of these proceedings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
and ordered the barons of the exchequer to
disregard the prohibition. But in a few weeks
his obstinacy was subdued by a succession of untoward
events. The people and clergy universally
favoured the cause of the earls; the Scots, after
their victory at Stirling, had burst into the northern
counties; and Edward himself lay at Ghent in
Flanders, unable to return to the protection of the
kingdom, and too weak to face the superior force
of the French king. In these circumstances, the
lords who composed the council of the young
Prince, invited the archbishop, six prelates, twenty-three
abbots and priors, the constable and mareschal,
and eight barons, to treat with them on matters of
the greatest moment, and summoned a parliament
to meet in London a week later (Sept. 30.), and
witness the confirmation of the two charters. In
the conferences which preceded, the two parties,
though opposed in appearance, had the same interests
and the same views; a form of peace (so
it was called) was speedily arranged; and, to the
ancient enactments of the charters, were appended
the following most important additions:&mdash;”No
tallage or aid shall henceforth be laid or levied by
us or our heirs in this our realm, without the goodwill
and common assent of the archbishops, bishops,
and other prelates, the earls, barons, knights, burgesses,
and other free men in our realm. No officer
of us or our heirs shall take corn, wool, hides,
or other goods, of any person whatsoever, without
the good will and assent of the owner of such
goods. Nothing shall henceforth be taken on the
sack of wool, under the name or pretence of
the evil toll. We also will and grant for us and our
heirs, that all both clergy and laity of our realm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
shall have their laws, liberties, and free customs,
as freely and wholly as at any time when
they had them best; and if any statutes have
been made or customs introduced by us or our
ancestors contrary to them, or to any article in the
present charter, we will and grant that such statutes
and customs be null and void for ever. We
have, moreover, remitted to the Earl Constable,
and Earl Mareschal and all their associates, and to
all those who have not accompanied us to Flanders,
all rancour and ill will, and all manner of offences
which they may have committed against us
or ours before the making of this present charter.
And for the greater assurance of this thing, we
will and grant for us and our heirs, that all archbishops
and bishops in England for ever, shall,
twice in the year after the reading of this charter
in their cathedral churches, excommunicate, and
cause, in their parochial churches, to be excommunicated,
all those that knowingly shall do or cause
to be done, any thing against the tenor, force and
effect of any article contained in it.</p>

<p>“When the parliament assembled (Oct. 10.),
these additions to the charter were received with
enthusiasm; and provided the King would assent
to them, the laity voted him an eighth, the clergy
of Canterbury a tenth, and the clergy of York a
fifth. The prince, by a public instrument, took the
Earls and their associates under his protection;
and the Lords of the Council bound themselves to
indemnify them against the effects of the royal displeasure.
A common letter was written to the
King, soliciting him to appease all differences by
giving his assent, and assuring him that his faithful
barons were ready at his command either to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
join him in Flanders, or to march against his enemies
in Scotland; but at the same time requiring,
in a tone of defiance, an answer against the sixth
day of December. It cost the haughty mind of
Edward several struggles, before he could prevail
on himself to submit: three days were spent in useless
deliberation and complaints; but at last, with a
reluctant hand, he signed the confirmation of the
two charters with the additional articles, and a separate
pardon for the Earls and their followers,
(Nov. 5.)</p>

<p>“This was perhaps the most important victory
which had hitherto been gained over the Crown.
By investing the people with the sole right of
raising the supplies, it armed them with the power
of checking the extravagance, and controlling the
despotism of their monarchs. Whatever jealousy
might be entertained of Edward’s intentions, his
conduct wore at first the semblance of sincerity.
As soon as an armistice had been concluded between
him and the King of France, he returned to
England, and appointed commissioners to inquire
into the illegal seizures which had been made previously
to his departure. They were to be divided
into two classes. Where the officers acted
without warrant, they were, at their own cost, to indemnify
the sufferers; where the goods had been
taken by the royal orders, their value was to be
certified into the exchequer, and prompt payment
was to be made. Still it was suspected that
he only waited for a favourable moment to cancel
the concessions which had been wrung from him
by necessity; and it was whispered that among
his confidential friends he had laughed at them as
being of no force, because they had been made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
a foreign country, where he possessed no authority.
When he met his parliament at York, the Earls
of Hereford and Norfolk required that he should
ratify his confirmation of the charters. He objected
from the necessity of hastening to oppose the
Scots, solemnly promised to comply with their request
on his return, and brought forward the Bishop
of Durham and three Earls, who swore ‘on
his soul,’ that he should fulfil his engagements.”
A. D. 1299. March. The victory of Falkirk and
a long series of success gave a lustre to his arms;
but when the parliament assembled the next year,
the King was reminded of his promise. His reluctance
employed every artifice to deceive the vigilance,
or exhaust the patience, of the two Earls.
He retired from the parliament in anger; he returned
and proposed modifications; at last he ratified
his former concessions, but with the addition
of a clause, which, by saving the rights of the
Crown, virtually annulled every provision in favour
of the subject. Bohun and Bigod instantly
departed with their adherents; and the King, to
ascertain the sentiments of the people, ordered the
sheriffs to assemble the citizens in the cemetery of
St Paul’s, and to read to them the new confirmation
of the charters. The lecture was repeatedly
interrupted by shouts of approbation; but when
the illusory clause was recited, the air rung with
expressions of discontent, and curses were poured
on the head of the prince, who had thus disappointed
the expectations of his people. Edward
took the alarm; summoned a new parliament to
meet him within a fortnight; granted every demand;
and appointed a commission of three Bishops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
three Earls, and three Barons, to ascertain
the real boundaries of the royal <span class="locked">forests.”<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span></p>

<p>In the foregoing extract, we find Edward, on the
14th July, holding up the Scots as a bugbear to
terrify his subjects into an acquiescence with his
oppressive demands; and on the 30th September
the English, in turn, are found making the
very same use of the Scots, for the purpose of extorting
from <i>their</i> reluctant and unprincipled “Justinian,”
the confirmation of their national liberties.
It did not, however, appear to strike them that the
subversion of freedom in Scotland was totally inconsistent
with its existence in the southern part
of the island.</p>

<p>By the same author we are also told, that after
the surrender of Stirling Castle in 1304, Edward
sent a secret deputation to the Pope, craving that
a dispensation might be granted him from the oaths
he had taken. This request appears to have been
complied with; but the learned author adds, “Whether
the papal rescript did not fully meet the
King’s wishes, or that he was intimidated by the
rebellion of the Scots, he made no public use of
its contents; but suffered the concessions, galling
as they were, to remain on the statute-roll at his
death, and descend to future sovereigns as the
recognised law of the land. Thus, after a long
struggle, was won, from an able and powerful monarch,
the most valuable of the privileges enjoyed
by the commons of England at the present day.
If we are indebted to the patriotism of Cardinal
Langton, and the Barons at Runnymead, the
framers of the great charter, we ought equally to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
revere the memory of Archbishop Winchelsey and
the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk. The former
erected barriers against the abuse of the sovereign
authority; the latter fixed the liberties of the subject
on a sure and permanent <span class="locked">foundation.”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> In
his list of meritorious characters, the learned author
ought certainly not to have omitted the
Knight of Elderslie and his patriotic followers, who,
in standing nobly forward for the independence of
their own country, were also instrumental in securing
such invaluable and lasting privileges for
their neighbours.</p>

<p>From the evidence adduced in the quotations
made, of the powerful diversion effected in favour
of English liberty by the stubborn opposition of
the Scots, it appears, that the success of the arms of
the latter was the palladium on which the most important
of England’s chartered rights depended.
When the people of England, therefore, think of
erecting monuments to the characters the worthy
Doctor has enumerated, it is to be hoped that a
tablet to the memory of the Guardian of Scotland
will not be forgotten, on which, with propriety, may
be inscribed</p>

<span class="subhead">ORIGINAL LETTER FROM SIR WILLIAM WALLACE AND SIR
ANDREW MURRAY.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_11">Page 11.</a></span></h2>

<p>It affords the writer no little pleasure, to be able
to lay before his readers the following authentic
document, which establishes beyond a doubt the
early and deep interest which Wallace took in the
re-establishment of the commercial prosperity of
Scotland. As this important writing, however,
has not hitherto appeared in the works of either
English or Scottish historians, nor even been alluded
to in any former account of Wallace, it will
be necessary to give some explanation respecting
the source from which it has been obtained. In
the Foreign Quarterly Review for August 1829,
the following notice appeared:&mdash;“Our Scottish
antiquarian friends will be gratified to hear, that
Dr Lappenberg of Hamburg, in his researches among
the ancient records of that city, has discovered
a letter, of the date 1287, addressed by
<i>Robert Wallace</i> and Andrew Murray to Hamburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
and Lubec.” An intimation of this kind could
not fail to excite a considerable degree of interest
in the writer; and the possibility that a mistake
might have occurred respecting the date, as well
as the name of one of the parties, encouraged the
hope, that a letter of William Wallace and Andrew
Murray, with which the public were unacquainted,
might still be in existence. Under this
impression, the writer communicated with an intelligent
friend, through whose means application
was made to Dr Lappenberg on the subject, who,
with that genuine politeness which seldom fails to
accompany distinguished merit, promptly communicated
a copy of the letter in question, taken from
the <i>original</i>, which still exists among the archives
of the Hanseatic city of <span class="locked">Lubec.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> The letter is to
the following <span class="locked">effect:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Andreas de Morauia et Willelmus Wallensis,

<p>“Andrew Murray and William Wallace, commanders
of the army of the kingdom of Scotland,
and the community of the same kingdom&mdash;To the
prudent and discreet men, and well-beloved friends,
the Mayors and Commonwealths of Lubeck and
of Hamburg, greeting, and perpetual increase of
sincere friendship.</p>

<p>“To us it has been intimated, by trust-worthy
merchants of the said kingdom of Scotland, that, as
a mark of your regard, you have been favourable to,
counselling and assisting in, all matters and transactions
relating to us and said merchants, though
[such good offices] may not have been preceded
by our deserts, and on that account we are the more
bound to tender you our thanks, and a suitable return.
This we have willingly engaged ourselves
to [perform towards] you, requesting, that in so
far you would cause your merchants to be informed,
that they will now have safe access to all the
ports of the kingdom of Scotland with their merchandise,
as the kingdom of Scotland, thanks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
God, has during the war been recovered from the
power of the English. Farewell.&mdash;Given at Badsington
[Haddington?<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>], in Scotland, this eleventh
day of October, in the year of grace one thousand
twelve hundred and ninety-seven.&mdash;We have moreover
to request, that you would condescend to
forward the interests of our merchants John Burnet
and John Frere in their business, in like manner
as you may wish us to act towards your merchants
in their commercial transactions. Farewell.&mdash;Dated
as above.”</p>

<p>Dr Lappenberg, in his valuable communication,
remarks, that this letter “appears to be the oldest
document existing relative to the intercourse
of Hamburg and Lubec, or other Hanseatic cities,
with <span class="locked">Scotland.”<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> As the reader will perceive,&mdash;a
mistake had occurred in the date, and
also in the name of Wallace.</p>

<p>From the above interesting muniment, various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
important points in our history may be established.
In the first place, it seems evident, that Wallace
and Murray, <i>up to the 11th October 1297</i>, acted
only as “duces exercitus regni Scotie,” in behalf
of the <i>community of said kingdom</i>; and that <i>the
commission from John Baliol</i>, authorizing them to
act under his sanction, must have been received
by them <i>on their march to England</i>, or <i>during the
time the devastation of that country was going forward</i>;
that is to say, between the 11th <i>October</i>
and 7th <i>November</i>, on which day the charter was
granted to the monks of <span class="locked">Hexham,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> where we find
“the name of the illustrious Prince John, by the
Grace of God King of Scotland,” is added to the
authorities mentioned in the above letter. And
again, that between the 7th <i>November</i> 1297, and
the 29th <i>March</i> 1298, <i>another commision</i> must
have been forwarded from <i>Baliol</i> to <i>Wallace</i> constituting
him the <i>sole Regent of the Kingdom of
Scotland</i>, as we find him on <i>that day</i> at Torphichen
granting, in that capacity, a charter to Alexander
Scrimgeor, and affixing to it the <i>seal of
Baliol</i>; which circumstance is mentioned in the
charter, while no mention is made of any seal
being used in that at <span class="locked">Hexham.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span></p>

<p>From the circumstance of Andrew Murray’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
name having precedence in the letter to the
Hanse Towns, and in the charter of Hexham, it
may with great probability be inferred, that these
two documents were either written by Wallace
himself, or under his direction. That he was qualified
for the task is evident, from the care which
had been bestowed on his education; first by his
uncle, and afterwards at the seminary of Dundee. If
Murray had either written them, or ordered them
to be written, it is not likely that he would have
placed his own name before one whose merits
were so generally acknowledged, as to procure
him the appointment of Regent in so short a time
afterwards; while Wallace, in placing, or causing
the name of Murray to be placed, before his own,
appears acting in perfect consistency with those
amiable traits in his character which we have already
noticed. As these writings are also free
from that monkish pedantry, and mystification
which pervades in the literature of that age, they
may with great probability be considered as the
composition of the talented <span class="locked">Liberator.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
It may be remarked, that the envy which a
number of the magnates of Scotland entertained
towards the Guardian, seems to have arisen after
his appointment to the Regency. How Sir Andrew
Murray demeaned himself on the occasion,
does not appear; but the conduct and feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Cumyn, his near <span class="locked">relation,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> were too unequivocally
expressed to be misunderstood.</p>

<p>The above letter, besides affording a good specimen
of the diplomatic talents of our hero, is at
the same time highly complimentary to the friendly
feelings and mercantile integrity of the merchants
of the two Hanse cities, and exhibits a singular
contrast to the policy of Philip, who, though bound
by treaties, allowed his allies to struggle on against
their powerful adversary, without affording
them the slightest assistance.</p>

<span class="subhead">MEMOIR OF PATRICK EARL OF <span class="locked">DUNBAR.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor smaller">92</a></span></span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_13">Page 13.</a></span></h2>

<p>This powerful and warlike baron was descended
from Gospatrick, the Governor of Northumberland,
in the time of William the Norman, who deprived
him of that office in consequence of his joining the
Danes in 1069, on their invasion of England.
He afterwards retired to Scotland, and sought the
protection of Malcolm III., who conferred on him
the Castle of Dunbar and the lands adjoining.
In virtue of this grant, his descendants were styled
Earls of March, and sometimes of Dunbar; the
former title being derived from the lands, the latter
from the name of the principal castle belonging to
the family. They were also possessed of the castle
of Coldbrands-path, a fortress of almost equal
importance.</p>

<p>Patrick, or (Corspatrick, as he is sometimes called),
the subject of the present notice, was the eighth
Earl of Dunbar; he succeeded to his father in 1289,
being then about forty-seven years of age. He was
one of the nobles who consented to the projected
marriage between prince Edward and Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the young Queen of Scotland. In 1291, he put
in his claim to the crown, among the other competitors,
founding his right on being the great-grandson
of Ilda or Ada, the daughter of William
king of Scots. On the commencement of hostilities
between Edward and Baliol, he adhered to
the former; but his castle of Dunbar being left in
possession of his wife Margery, daughter of Alexander
Comyn, Earl of Buchan, she delivered it
over to Baliol&mdash;conceiving the duties she owed
her country paramount to the injunctions of her
husband.</p>

<p>Whatever blame may be attached to this Earl,
for the active part he took against the interest of
Scotland, still the merit of consistency must be awarded
to him in the crooked line of policy he adopted;
for, having sworn fealty to Edward in 1291,
he adhered to the interests of his over-lord with
zeal and fidelity. The <span class="locked">answer<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> which he returned
to Wallace and the Scottish barons assembled
at Perth, is quite in accordance with that tone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
independence assumed by the family, and which,
according to Lord Hailes, was so prejudicial to
Scotland.</p>

<p>After being driven from Scotland, as has already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
been stated, he continued to molest his
countrymen as he found occasion. In 1298, he
was actively engaged in the Scottish wars, and in
November was appointed one of Edward’s Lieutenants
in Scotland. In 1300, he and his <span class="locked">son,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span>
a youth at that time about 15 years of age, were
present at the siege of Carlaverock castle, when
he must have been at least 58 years old. In 33d
Edward I., he was to have attended the parliament
as one of the representatives of the Commons of
Scotland; but from some reason or other, he did
not appear. On the 30th September 1308, he
was commanded by Edward II. to assist in suppressing
the insurrection of Bruce, but what efforts
he made, cannot well be ascertained. In the
following year he died, and was succeeded by
Patrick, his son by the daughter of the Earl of
Buchan.</p>

<p>The intentions of Edward to curtail the power
of his barons, and render them more subservient
to his will, were most unequivocally displayed in
his proceedings towards Bigod, Earl of Norfolk,
immediately after his return from the conquest of
Scotland. The imperious language of the tyrant,
and the bold and determined conduct of the vassal,
the reader will find narrated in the extracts
from Dr Lingard, inserted in the concluding chapter
of the narrative. The plans of Edward for
the extinction of British freedom, were such as
have been generally resorted to by other despots,
who have encroached upon the rights of their subjects
or neighbours. While the Scots were summoned
to fight his battles in France, the Welsh were
marched to Scotland to assist in the subjugation of
that country; and had the former remained passive
under the yoke, there is every reason to believe that
they would soon, in their turn, have been employed
to enforce the arbitrary measures of the ambitious
monarch upon the subjects of his native
kingdom. Thus Scotland, England and Wales,
would have mutually assisted in rivetting the fetters
of each other.</p>

<p>With respect to the fate of Christell of Seyton,
some little inquiry may be necessary. It is well
known, that a person of his name appears to great
advantage in the history of the struggles of Bruce,
and afterwards became a martyr in his cause; of
course, he could not have been the individual mentioned
in the text. It appears from various sources,
that there were three of the Seyton family, of the
name of Christell, grandfather, father, and son. If
any of these were killed in the above battle, it must
have been the second, for the first, “a man given
more to devotion nor worldliness,” died in the
reign of Alexander III. As the other two were
both engaged in the contest for independence along
with Wallace, the following account of them may be
interesting to the reader. It is taken from the
History of the House of Seyton, by Sir Richard
Maitland of Lethington, and lately printed by the
Maitland Club, from the MS. in the Advocates’
Library.</p>

<span class="subhead">MEMOIR OF FITZ-MARMADUKE.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_33">Page 33.</a></span></h2>

<p>“This stern soldier was the eldest son of Marmaduke
Fitz-Geoffrey, Lord of Hordene, in the
bishoprick of Durham, who, in the 45th Henry
III., 1260&ndash;1, obtained the King’s license to embattle
his mansion-house there. In August 1282,
John Fitz-Marmaduke, with nine other knights,
performed services due from the Bishop of Durham,
who styled him, on another occasion, “Nostre
tres cher bachelier, Mons<sup>r</sup>. Jehan le Fitz-Marmaduk;”
but from that time nothing is recorded of
him, until February 1301, when he was a party
to the Letter from the Barons to the Pontiff, in
which he is called “Lord of Hordene,” excepting
that he was at the siege of Carlaverock in
June 1300, where his bravery was particularly
conspicuous. He came, we are told, to assail the
castle with a great and full troop of good and select
bachelors, and stood as firm as a post, and
his banner received many a rent difficult to mend.</p>

<p>“It is most extraordinary, that for nearly twenty
years, no notice can be found in the records of an
individual who, at the end of that period, was a
party to an instrument from the Baronage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
realm; and it was from this circumstance, the similarity
of their arms, and his surname, that he
was confounded with Marmaduke de Thweng in
the “Synopsis of the Peerage.”</p>

<p>“In the 31st Edward I., Fitz-Marmaduke was
commanded to appear before the King on the first
Sunday in Lent, with full powers from the community
of the Bishoprick of Durham, to accept
his Majesty’s mediation between them and the Bishop;
and, in April in the same year, he was appointed
a Commissioner of Array. On the 30th
September, 1st Edward II. 1307, he was ordered,
with others, to proceed to Galloway, to repress
the rebellion of Robert de Brus; and, in October
following he was commanded to serve with horse
and arms against the Scots; after which time his
name does not occur among the writs of service.
He continued in the wars of Scotland, “comme
une estache;” and, on the 21st June 1308, was
again enjoined to oppose the attempts of Bruce.
On the 16th February, 3d Edward II., 1310, he
was authorized, with others, to treat with the
Scots for a truce. Fitz-Marmaduke died in 1311,
at which time he was governor of St John’s Town
of Perth; and a very curious fact is recorded respecting
his funeral. He particularly requested to
be interred within the precincts of the cathedral of
Durham, but, as the state of the country prevented
the removal of his corpse in the usual manner,
his domestics adopted the expedient of dismembering
the body, and then boiling the flesh
from the bones; by which means they preserved
his reliques, until an opportunity offered of transmitting
them with safety across the border. For
this outrage against an ecclesiastical canon, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
had been promulgated in consequence of the frequency
of the practice, Cardinal Berengarius, Bishop
of Jerusalem, imposed on the offenders the mild
penance of attending their master’s obsequies in the
cemetery of the cathedral of Durham, having first
used the authority of the church to ensure the quiet
transportation of his remains.</p>

<p>“Fitz-Marmaduke was twice married; first, to
Isabella, sister, and heiress of Robert Brus of Stanton,
by whom he had Richard, his son and heir,
and a daughter, Mary, who married &mdash;&mdash; Lumley;
and, secondly, Ida, who survived him, and was
living his widow in 1313. Richard Fitz-Marmaduke
was Seneschal of the Bishoprick of Durham,
and was slain, in 1318, by his kinsman Robert
Neville, on the Old Bridge of Durham, as he was
riding to hold the county court, which event is described
as “a most strange and detestable action.”
Though married to Alianora &mdash;&mdash;, he died without
children, when Mary, his sister, became his
heiress. She left issue Robert Lumley of Ravensholm,
who married Lucia, the daughter and co-heiress
of Marmaduke de Thweng. They had issue
a son, Marmaduke Lumley, whose representative
is the present Earl of Scarborough.”</p>

<span class="subhead">MEMOIR OF BRIAN FITZ-ALAN.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_38">Page 38.</a></span></h2>

<p>“Brian Fitz-Alan succeeded his father Brian
before the 5th Edward I., and on the 6th April,
10th Edward I. 1282, and 14th June 1287, was
summoned to serve with horse and arms in Wales.
In the 19th Edward I., he obtained permission to
make a castle of his house at Kilwardeby in Yorkshire;
and in the following year, being one of
King Edward’s vicegerents in Scotland, he, with
others, received that monarch’s precept to give
John de Balliol possession of the kingdom. He
was a witness to that personage’s surrender of his
crown on the 10th July 1296, about which time
he was constituted the King’s Lieutenant in Scotland.
Fitz-Alan was present at the siege of Carlaverock
in June 1300; and in the ensuing February,
was a party to the Letter from the Barons
to Pope Boniface, in which he is styled, “Lord of
Bedale.” His seal affixed to that document has
been the subject of remark, for instead of containing
his arms, it presents a whimsical assemblage
of animals, apparently consisting of two birds, a
rabbit, a stag, and a pig or boar, all of which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
looking to the dexter excepting the latter, which
is regarding the chief, and is inscribed with this
curious legend,</p>

<p class="center small">TOT.CAPITA.TOT.SENTENCIE.</p>

<p>“The inference to be drawn from this singular
seal tends to establish, that its owner was eccentric
or satirical; for it must either have been used
from unmeaning caprice, or with the intention of
ridiculing the devices in the signets of his contemporaries.
The allusion in the poem (The siege
of Carleverock) to the arms of Fitz-Alan, is too
important to be allowed to pass unnoticed. It not
only informs us of an event in his life, by proving
that he had been involved in a dispute with Hugh
Poyntz, but shows that it was always one of the
fundamental laws of arms, that no two persons
should bear the same ensigns, and that there was
then sufficient pride felt on the point to resent its
infringement.</p>

<p>“All that is farther known of Fitz-Alan is, that
he was summoned to Parliament from the 23d June
23d Edward I. 1295, to the 22d January, 33d
Edward I. 1305, though he died in 1302. The
name of his wife is not stated, but it is almost certain
that he married late in life; for, according to
a note of the inquisition held on his death, Maud
his daughter was his heir; though, at the death of
his brother Theobald Fitz-Alan, on the 1st Edward
II. 1307&ndash;8, his heirs are said to have been
Maud and Katherine, the daughters of his brother
Brian Fitz-Alan, the former of whom was then
aged seven years, and the latter five; so that Katherine,
who made proof of her age on the 12th
Edward II., was probably a posthumous child. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
discrepancy, however, exists on the subject; for,
agreeable to a note of the inquisition on the death
of this baron, his daughter Maud was then eight
years old, and Dugdale says that Katherine was
at the same time aged six, which, if the other statement
be correct, was impossible. Of these daughters,
Maud married Sir Gilbert Stapleton, and, according
to a pedigree in Dodsworth’s MSS., secondly
Thomas Sheffield; and Katherine became
the wife of John Lord Grey of Rotherfield. Brian
Fitz-Alan was buried in the south aisle of Bedale
church in Yorkshire, and a sumptuous monument
was there erected to his memory, a beautiful engraving
and accurate description of which are given
in Blore’s “Monumental Remains.” Sir Brian
is said to have possessed a very elegant figure, and
manners highly polished for the age.”</p>

<span class="subhead">MEMOIR OF AYMER DE VALENCE, EARL OF PEMBROKE.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_71">Page 71.</a></span></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Aymer de Valence</span> was the third son of William
de Valence, who was created Earl of Pembroke
by his uterine brother King Henry the
Third. He was born about 1280, and succeeded
his father in his honours on the 13th June 1296,
both of his elder brothers having previously died
without issue. The earliest notice of him which
is recorded, is, that on the 26th January, 25th
Edward I., 1297, he was summoned to Parliament
as a baron, though, according to modern opinions
on the subject, he was fully entitled to the earldom
of Pembroke, nor was the title ever attributed
to him in public records, until the 6th November,
1st Edward II. 1307; and the first writ
to Parliament addressed to him as “Earl of Pembroke,”
was tested on the 18th of the following
January. Upon this remarkable circumstance,
some observations have been recently made; but
it is wholly impossible to explain the cause of the
anomaly in a satisfactory manner. Although never
styled “Earl of Pembroke” until the accession
of Edward II., it is manifest, that from the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
of his father, he ranked above all barons excepting
Henry of Lancaster, who being of the blood royal,
is uniformly mentioned next to Earls; hence it
appears, that notwithstanding his claim was not
positively acknowledged, he was considered to be
entitled to a higher degree of precedency than belonged
to the baronial dignity. In the 25th Edward
I., he was in the expedition into Flanders,
and, in the same year, was appointed a commissioner
to ratify an agreement between the King
and Florence, Count of Holland, relative to some
auxiliaries from the Count in that war; and was
likewise one of the ambassadors sent by Edward
to treat for a truce between England and France.
In the 26th and 27th Edward I., he was in the
Scottish wars, and in June 1300, in the 28th Edward
I., was present at the siege of Carlaverock,
when he must have been about twenty-one years
of age; but the poet pays him no other compliment
than what a pun upon his name suggested.</p>

<p class="in4">
“Le Valence Aymars li Vaillans.”
</p>

<p>“In the following year, he was a party to the
Barons’ letter to the Pope, in which, though his
name occurs immediately after that of the Earl of
Arundel, and before Henry de Lancaster’s, he is
only styled ‘Lord of Montiniac.’ Shortly afterwards,
he was appointed to treat with the ambassadors
of the King of France on the subject of
peace. In the 31st Edward I., he was again in
the wars of Scotland; and, in the same year, received
permission to leave the realm upon his own
affairs. He obtained a grant, in 1305, of the Castles
of Selkirk and Traquair, and of the borough
of Peebles in Scotland, to hold by the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
one knight’s fee, together with other possessions
in that kingdom; and, in the 34th Edward I.,
was constituted Guardian of the Marches of Scotland
towards Berwick, when he was intrusted with
the sole command of the English forces which had
been levied against Robert Bruce. In the instrument
by which he was appointed to that important
duty, as well as in most others, he is styled “Dilectum
consanguineum et fidelum nostrum.” The
appellation of “Cousin” was not then a mere title
of honour, when addressed to a peer, but was
used in its most literal sense; and Aymer de
Valence’s claim to it is shown by the following
slight pedigree.</p>

</pre>

<p>“The successes which attended this nobleman
against Robert Bruce, are described by a contemporary
chronicler; and it is said that Valence,
after a severe contest, pursued Bruce, and presuming
that he would take refuge in Kildrummie
castle, he gained possession of that place, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
finding only Nigel de Bruce, brother of Robert,
there, he caused him and all who were with him,
to be immediately hung. This action has given
rise to some pertinent remarks by the able biographer
of the Earl in the beautiful work before
<span class="locked">noticed,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span> who has satisfactorily shown that Nigel
was not put to death by him, but that at least the
forms of law were practised on the occasion. On
the deathbed of Edward I., Pembroke, with some
other personages, received the King’s dying injunctions
to afford his son their counsel and support,
and not to permit Piers de Gaveston to return
into England. His strict adherence to this
command, naturally excited the favourite’s displeasure;
and he is said, in derision of his tall stature
and pallid complexion, to have termed him
“Joseph the Jew.” In the first year of the young
monarch’s reign, Valence was, as has been before
observed, allowed and summoned to Parliament
by his proper title of Earl of Pembroke; and at
the coronation of that monarch, he carried the
King’s left boot, but the spur belonging to it was
borne by the Earl of Cornwall. In the same year,
after performing homage upon the death of his
mother for her lands, he was joined with Otho de
Grandison in an embassy to the Pope; and in the
3d Edward II., was found heir to his sister Agnes,
or more probably Anne. It has been considered,
from the circumstance of the Earl being a witness
to the instrument by which the King recalled Gaveston,
and bestowed the possessions of the Earl of
Cornwall upon him, that he approved of, or at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
consented to, those acts; but this idea rests upon
far too uncertain evidence to be relied upon; and
if he ever changed his opinion it was of short duration,
for in the 3d Edward II., he joined the
Earl of Lancaster against Gaveston, and when he
was banished the realm in 1311, the Earl of Pembroke
was one of the persons deputed to petition
the King that he should be rendered incapable of
ever holding any office.</p>

<p>“In the 6th Edward II., he was again sent on a
mission to Rome, and in the same year obtained a
grant of lands in London, in which was included
the New Temple. In the 7th Edward II. he was
appointed Custos and Lieutenant of Scotland, untill
the arrival of the King, and was present at the
fatal battle of Bannockburn. Two inedited MSS.
cited in the “Monumental Remains,” allude to
the Earl’s conduct on that occasion, in words fatal
either to his loyalty or his courage: the one stating
that “<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Insuper Comes de Pembrok, Henricus
de Bellomonte, et multi magnates, <i>cordetenus
Pharisei</i>, a certamine recesserunt</span>;” and the other,
that “<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">in pedibus suis evasit ex acie et cum Valensibus
fugientibus se salvavit</span>.” In all probability,
however, the language was in both instances that of
an enemy, and deserves but little credit; though,
even if it were true, “there is no great disgrace,”
as the learned biographer, from whose memoir these
extracts are taken, has truly remarked, “in seeking
safety by flight when defeat was inevitable, and the
whole army pursued a similar course.”</p>

<p>“In the 9th Edward II., the Earl was a commissioner
for holding a Parliament in the King’s
absence, and he took an active part in the proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
therein. Being sent to Rome on a mission
to the Pontiff, a singular misfortune befel him, as
he was taken prisoner on his return by a Burgundian
called John de Moiller with his accomplices,
and sent to the Emperor, who obliged him to pay
a ransom of 20,000 pounds of silver, upon the absurd
pretence that Moiller had served the King of
England without being paid his wages. Edward
used every exertion to procure the Earl’s liberty,
and wrote to several sovereign princes, soliciting
them to interfere on the subject; but he did not
immediately succeed. In the 11th Edward II.,
Pembroke was once more in the Scottish wars,
and was appointed governor of Rockingham castle;
and upon the King’s purposed voyage in the 13th
Edward II., to do homage to the King of France
for the Duchy of Acquitaine, he was constituted
Guardian of the realm during his absence, being
then also Custos of Scotland. In the 15th Edward
II., he sat in judgment on the Earl of Lancaster
at Pontefract; and for his conduct on the
occasion, was rewarded with the grant of several
manors.</p>

<p>“In March 1309, the Earl of Pembroke was one
of the peers appointed to regulate the royal household;
in the 5th Edward II., he was commanded
not to approach the place where the Parliament
was held with an armed retinue, or in any other
manner than was observed in the time of the late
King; in the 8th Edward II., he was a commissioner
to open and continue a parliament at
York; in the 12th Edward II., he was sent to
Northampton with others to treat with the Earl
of Lancaster, for the better government of the realm,
and was one of the peers then appointed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
about the King’s person, at which time he signed
the agreement between the King and that Earl;
he advised the reversal of the judgment against
Hugh le Despencer the younger; by writ tested
on the 19th January, 14 Edward II. 1321, he
was appointed a commissioner to treat for peace
with Robert de Brus; and in the 18th Edward
II., the Earl, as Justice in Eyre of the Forest of
Essex, claimed the appointment of Marshal thereof.</p>

<p>“The Earl of Pembroke accompanied Isabel,
Queen of England to France in 1323; and is said
to have lost his life in that year, at a tournament
given by him, to celebrate his nuptials with his
third wife, Mary, daughter of Guy de Chastillon,
Count of St Paul’s; though, from the obscure manner
in which his death is mentioned by some chroniclers,
and the attempt which they have made to
consider it as a mark of the vengeance of Heaven
for his conduct relative to the Earl of Lancaster,
Dugdale asserts that he was murdered on the 23d
June 1324, “by reason he had a hand” in that affair.
But the former statement his recent biographer
considers to be corroborated by the following
lines in a long MS. poem, containing a
life of the Earl, in the Cottonian collection, written
by Jacobus Nicholaus de Dacia, who calls
himself a scholar of Mary de St Paul, Countess of
Pembroke; by which he probably meant that he
belonged to Pembroke Hall, which she had founded.</p>

<p>“From the annexed account of the Earl’s death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
however, by another contemporary writer, it would
appear that he died of apoplexy:</p>

<p>The following account of the Earl of Pembroke
is from the pen of Hutchinson. “This Earl”
(Adomer de Valence) “seemed to have a divine
interdict depending over him, and the immediate
vindictive hand of Providence to be upon him and
his posterity for his atrocious deeds. He was a
tool to his prince, and servilely submitted to the
mandate of the crown, contrary to the dictates of
humanity, honour, and justice. He sat in judgment
on Thomas Earl of Lancaster, and impiously
acquiesced in his sentence. He was a chief instrument
in apprehending the famous Scottish patriot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Wallace in 1305; accomplishing his capture
by the treachery of his most intimate associates,
and those in whom he placed his utmost confidence,
Sir John Menteith and others of infamous
memory. <i>Adomer</i>, on his bridal day, was slain in
a tournament, held in honour of his nuptials; and
left a wife at once a <i>maiden</i>, <i>bride</i> and <i>widow</i>. It
is said that, for several generations of this family,
<i>a father was never happy enough to see his son</i>,
the proscribed parent being snatched off by the
hand of death before the birth of his issue.” (<i>Hutchinson’s
History of Northumberland.</i>)</p>

<p>It may be also remarked as a singular coincidence,
the fatality which attended the Stuarts after
they came to the throne, not one of whom, for
many generations, died a natural death. John
Menteith was the son of Walter Stuart, Earl of
Menteith, and of the same family which afterwards
swayed the Scottish sceptre.</p>

<p>Aymer, or Adomer de Valence, is likewise
charged by the Minstrel, as being the instrument
made use of for corrupting the fidelity of Menteith;
and he mentions, that the infamous bargain
was finally concluded in “<i>Ruglyne Kirk</i>,” where
the two met by appointment, and that Menteith
received from Valence three thousand crowns of
gold as the price of his friend. “<i>Ruglyne</i>” is situated
nearly mid-way between Bothwell and Dumbarton
castles; the former being the place where
the Earl of Pembroke usually resided when in
Scotland, and was quite convenient for his keeping
an appointment at “<i>Ruglyne</i>” with the governor
of Dumbarton Castle. When it is recollected,
that John Comyn, who, according to
“<i>Douglas’s peerage</i>,” married a sister of Valence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
was hatching the treason which he afterwards put
in practice against Bruce, at the time when his
brother-in-law was tampering with the friend of
Wallace, it will not be doing him great injustice,
if we suppose him <i>at least</i> in the secret of the infamous
transaction with Menteith. In fact, both
of these deeds of darkness appear to have been
part of the same plan for placing Comyn, and consequently
the sister of the Earl of Pembroke, on
the Scottish throne.</p>

<p>The Earl was thrice married; first, to Beatrix,
daughter of Ralph de Noel, Constable of France;
secondly, to a daughter of the Earl of Barre; and
thirdly, to Mary, daughter of Guy de Chastillon,
Count of St Paul; but he had no issue; and the
descendants of his sisters, Isabel, the wife of John
Baron Hastings, and Joan, who married John Comyn
of Badenoch, are consequently his representatives.
His eldest sister, Anne, married, first,
Maurice Fitz-Gerald; secondly, Hugh de Balliol;
and, lastly, John de Avennes; and probably died,
S. P. in the 3d Edward II.</p>

<p>Mary, Countess of Pembroke, is chiefly known
to the present age by an action, which seldom fails
to ensure immortality. She was the foundress of
a College for the purposes of learning and religion,
which still bears the name of Pembroke Hall; and
was likewise a benefactress to several religious
houses. She died about 1376; and on the 13th
March in that year made her will at Braxted, in
Essex, by which she ordered her body to be buried
in the church of the sisters of Denny, where
she had caused her tomb to be made; and bequeathed
to the church of the Abbey of Westminster,
where her husband was interred, a cross, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
a foot of gold and emeralds, which Sir William de
Valence, Knight, brought from the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The body of the Earl of Pembroke was conveyed
to England, and buried in Westminster Abbey;
but upon the beautiful tomb erected to his
memory, it is unnecessary to say a single word,
ample justice having been done to it by the artist
and the author of a biographical notice, which accompanies
a recent engraving of his tomb.</p>

<span class="subhead">MEMOIR OF HENRY DE LACY, EARL OF LINCOLN.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_86">Page 86.</a></span></h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Henry de Lacy</span> was the eldest son of Edmund
de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, by Alice, the daughter
of the Marquess of Saluces in Italy. He succeeded
his father in the earldom in 1257, at which
time he was probably about nine years of age, his
parents having been married in May 1247. The
first circumstance relating to the Earl after his
birth, of which we have any notice, was his marriage,
in 1256, to Margaret, the eldest daughter
and co-heiress of William de Longespee, the covenants
of which are given by Dugdale. In 1269,
the Earl became involved in a dispute about some
lands with John Earl Warren, and each party prepared
to establish his claim by force of arms; but
their intention becoming known to the King, he
commanded his Justices to hear and determine the
cause, who decided it in favour of the Earl of
Lincoln. William de Longespee, his wife’s father,
died in the 52d Henry III.; and soon afterwards
the Countess and her husband performed homage
for, and obtained livery of, all the lands which had
in consequence devolved upon her. In her right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
he is considered to have become Earl of Salisbury,
the said William de Longespee having been entitled
to that dignity, though he was never allowed
it, as son and heir of William de Longespee, the
natural son of King Henry II., by the well-known
Rosamond Clifford, who obtained the Earldom of
Salisbury by his marriage with Elizabeth, the
daughter and heiress of William d’Evereux. On
the feast of St Edward, 18th March 1272,
the Earl of Lincoln received the honour of
knighthood, and in the same year was appointed
Governor of Knaresborough Castle. In 5th
Edward I. he had livery of the fee which his ancestors
had usually received ‘<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nomine comitatûs
Lincoln</i>’ with all the arrears from the time he was
invested by King Henry III. with the sword of
that earldom. Upon several occasions, between
the 6th and 10th Edward I., he obtained grants
of fairs, markets, and free-warrens in different
parts of his domains; and in the year last mentioned,
he accompanied the expedition then sent
into Wales. Leland asserts that the Earl built
the town of Denbigh, the land of which had been
granted to him “from his having married into
the blood of those princes, and that he walled it,
and erected a castle, on the front of which was a
statue of him in long robes; and that anciently
prayers were offered in Saint Hillary’s chapel in
that place, for Lacy and Percy.”</p>

<p>“Dugdale considers, that his surrender of the castle
and barony of Pontefract to the King, with all
the honours thereto belonging, in the 20th Edward
I., arose from his “having been long married,
and doubting whether he should ever have
issue, but upon condition, as it seems,” for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
king, by his charter, dated at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
28th December, 21. Edward I., re-granted the
same to him and to the heirs of his body, with remainder
to Edmund Earl of Lancaster, the King’s
brother, and to the heirs of his body, failing which,
to the king and his heirs. In almost the next paragraph,
however, that eminent writer says, “that
in the 22d Edward I., the Earl received a grant
of several manors from the King, with remainder
to Thomas, the son of Edmund Earl of Lancaster,
and Alice his wife, sole daughter of the Earl,
and to the heirs of their two bodies lawfully begotten,
and failing such issue, to the right heirs
of the said Thomas” from which it would appear,
that, at the time of the surrender by the
Earl of Lincoln to the King, the said Alice was
living; and which is further confirmed by his saying,
in a subsequent page, that she was 28 years
of age at the death of her father in 1312, in
which case she must have been above seven at
the time in question. In the 20. Edward I., the
Earl was sent as ambassador to the King of France,
to treat on the subject of the restraint of those pirates
who robbed some French merchants; and in
the 22d year of that monarch he again attended
him into Wales, and was likewise in the expedition
sent into Gascony. He accompanied the
Earl of Lancaster, in the 24. Edward I., into Brittany,
and was present at various successes of the
English forces. On the death of that nobleman,
he succeeded him in his command, and besieged
the town of Aux with great vigour, though without
success, and was forced to retreat to Bayonne;
from which place he marched, with John de St
John, towards Bellegard, which was then besieged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
by the Count d’Artois. The engagement which
took place in the vicinity of that town, does not,
from Dugdale’s relation of it, appear to have added
to the reputation of the Earl, as he informs us,
upon the authority of Walsingham, that “approaching
a wood about three miles from Bellegard,
he divided his army into two parts, whereof
the van was led by John de St John, and the rear
by himself; but having past the wood where St
John, meeting the enemy, began the fight, discerning
their strength, he retreated to Bayonne,
leaving the rest to shift for themselves, so that St
John and many others were by reason thereof
taken prisoners.” Whatever stain this circumstance
might have cast upon his military character,
seems to have been partially removed towards the
end of that year, by his having obliged the enemy
to raise the siege which they had laid to St Katherine’s,
in Gascony; soon after which he proceeded
into Flanders, and thence returned to England.
In the ensuing year, 27. Edward I., he was
summoned by writ, tested 17th September, 27.
Edward I., 1299, to be at York, with horse and
arms, on the morrow of the Feast of St Martin,
to serve against the Scots; and, in the next year,
he is stated to have been sent to the Pope, with
Sir Hugh Spencer, to complain of injuries received
from the Scots; and about the same time he
was appointed Lieutenant of Gascony. In the 29.
Edward I., he was made Governor of Corfe Castle,
from which year until the 31. Edward I., when he
was joined in commission with the Bishop of Winchester
to treat of peace between England and
France, Dugdale gives no account of him.</p>

<p>“It was, however, on the 24th June, in the 29.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Edward I., anno 1300, when the Earl must have
been above 50 years of age, that he commanded
the first division of the army which besieged Carlaverock
Castle. The only characteristic trait recorded
of him by the poet, is that of valour, which,
we are told, was the principal feeling that animated
his heart, and in so rude an age, this attribute
was perhaps the highest and most gratifying praise
that could be imagined. His name does not afterwards
occur in that production, from which we
may conclude, that his services at the siege and
assault were not very conspicuous. In 1305, the
Earl was again employed on a mission to the Pope,
being deputed with the Bishops of Lichfield and
Worcester to attend the inauguration of the Pontiff
at Lyons, and to present him, in the name of the
King, with several vessels of pure gold. After
having executed this command, it appears that he
was once more in the wars in Gascony, and in
the ensuing year was similarly employed in Scotland.
Upon the death of the King, at Burgh in
Cumberland, the Earl was one of the Peers who
attended him in his last moments, and received
his solemn request to be faithful to his son, and
not to allow Piers de Gaveston to return into
England. Immediately after Edward’s demise, he
joined some Earls and Barons in a solemn engagement
to defend the young King, his honour and
authority; and at his coronation he is recorded to
have carried one of the swords borne at that ceremony;
shortly after which he was appointed Governor
of Skipton Castle. His conduct seems to
have secured the confidence of the new monarch,
for, upon his expedition towards Scotland in the
3d and 4th years of his reign, the Earl of Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
was constituted Governor of the realm during his
absence.</p>

<p>“The preceding account of this personage has
been almost entirely taken from Sir William Dugdale’s
Baronage. The only facts which have been
ascertained relating to him, not stated in that work,
are, that he was one of the Mainpernors for the
Earl of Gloucester in 1292; that he was a Receiver
and Trier of Petitions in 1304; that he
was present in the parliament held at Carlisle
in February, 35th Edward I., 1307; and that he
was one of the Peers appointed to regulate the
King’s household in May, 3d Edward II., 1309.</p>

<p>“His works of piety were proportionate to his
extensive possessions, and, adopting this criterion
of his religious sentiments, we may conclude that
he was not behind his contemporaries in superstition
or devotion. Amongst his more substantial
gifts to the church, was his large contribution to
the “new work” at St Paul’s Cathedral in London;
and three gilt crosses and a carbuncle, and
a cup of silver gilt, which was said to have belonged
to the shrine of St Edmund, in the abbey of Salley.</p>

<p>“The Earl of Lincoln closed a long and active
career in 1312, at Lincoln’s <span class="locked">Inn,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> in the suburbs of
London, being then about sixty-three or sixty-four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
years of age, and he is reported to have called
his son-in-law, the Earl of Lancaster, to him, upon
his death-bed, and, after representing how highly
“it had pleased God to honor and enrich him
above others,” he told him that “he was obliged
to love and honor God above all things;” and
then added, “See’st thou the Church of England,
heretofore honourable and free, enslaved by Romish
oppressions, and the King’s wicked exactions? See’st
thou the common people, impoverished by tributes
and taxes, and, from the condition of freemen, reduced
to servitude? See’st thou the nobility, formerly
venerable throughout Christendom, vilified
by aliens, in their own native country? I therefore
charge thee, by the name of Christ to stand
up like a man for the honor of God and his
church, and the redemption of thy country, associating
thyself to that valiant, noble, and prudent
person, Guy, Earl of Warwick, when it shall be
most proper to discourse of the public affairs of
the kingdom, who is so judicious in counsel, and
mature in judgment. Fear not thy opposers who
shall contest against thee in the truth, and if thou
pursuest this my advice, thou shalt gain eternal
honour!” This patriotic speech, which is attributed
to him by Walsingham, who wrote in the
fifteenth century, is worthy of attention, as conveying
the view taken of the affairs of the period
by a monk about one hundred years afterwards;
for it would require extraordinary credulity to
consider that it was really uttered by the dying
Earl, whose whole life does not appear to present
a single action indicative of the sentiments there
attributed to him. His body was buried in the
eastern part of St Paul’s Cathedral in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
between the chapel of our Lady and that of St
Dunstan.</p>

<p>“The Earl of Lincoln was twice married, first
to Margaret de Longespee before-mentioned, by
whom he had a son, Edmond de Lacy, who was
drowned in a well in a high tower, called the Red
Tower, in Denbigh Castle, in his father’s lifetime;
and a daughter, Alice, the wife of Thomas Earl
of Lancaster, who was his sole heiress, and, at the
Earl’s death, was twenty-eight years of age. His
second wife was Joan, sister and heiress of William
Baron Martin, who survived him, and was
remarried to Nicholas Baron Audley.</p>

<p>“Alice, Countess of Lancaster, whose romantic
life has been made the subject of a popular novel,
styled herself, as sole inheritrix of the extensive possessions
of her father and mother, Countess of
Lincoln and Salisbury. She was thrice married;
first to the Earl of Lancaster; secondly, to Eubolo le
Strange; and, thirdly, to Hugh le Frenes; but died
without issue on the Thursday next after the feast
of St Michael, 22d Edward III., <i>i. e.</i> 2nd October
1348, when the representation of the powerful
house of Lacy became vested in the descendants
of Maud, the sister of Henry Earl of Lincoln,
who married Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester.”</p>

<span class="subhead">MEMOIRS OF RICHARD SIWARD, AND WALTER DE HUNTERCOMBE.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_97">Page 97.</a></span></h2>

<p>We shall here insert some account of Richard
Siward and Walter de Huntercombe, two characters
who appeared on this occasion. The latter,
besides being at the siege of Carlaverock, where
he attracted the notice of the poet, who mentions
him as the handsome Huntercombe, bearing “ermine
with two red gemmells,” was also governor
of Edinburgh castle, and engaged in almost every
campaign which Edward made in Scotland. The
following notice, therefore, abridged from Mr Nicolas,
will be useful in supplying that information
respecting him which it has been inconvenient to
give in the course of the narrative. It is also the
more necessary, from the circumstance of the writer
being pledged, in the advertisement of the “Life
of Wallace,” to furnish “biographical notices of
contemporary English and Scottish warriors” who
figured in the contest between the two countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Siward.</span>&mdash;“Though this individual is
frequently spoken of in the records of his day, yet
very few particulars are known that can throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
much light on his family pedigree. It has been
conjectured, that he was descended from Syward,
the great Saxon Earl of Northumberland; but of
this, however, there is little certainty. His importance
appears to have been considerable; for
we find that, on 18th November 1292, he was appointed
by Edward I. (in his character of Umpire
on the question of the Succession) to act as Governor
of the Castles of Dumfries, Wigton, and
Kirkcudbright. On the 22d April, 1294, he obtained
a grant of the marriage of the widow of Simon
Fresel, or Frazer; and on the 15th October, in
the same year, he was summoned to attend the
English monarch, with all his retainers, in the expedition
to Wales. Towards the end of 1295,
he affected to unite with the Scottish Barons in
their attempt to restore their King to the dignity
of an independent sovereign, and, in consequence,
had the defence of the Castle of Dunbar assigned
to him. How he conducted himself on that occasion,
has already been noticed. His subsequent
confinement in the Tower, has been adduced by
some writers as a powerful argument against the
charge of treason brought against him by his countrymen.
We cannot, however, see it in that light.
His treachery was of the most profligate description.
By negociating the surrender of a fortress,
which, from its strength and importance, was
reckoned in those days the key of the kingdom,
and also using it, at the same time, as a trap to ensnare
the greater part of the nobility, was conduct
that required the exercise of some <i>ruse</i> in order
to lessen the odium it was calculated to excite
even in the estimation of the English nobility,
who must otherwise have looked with disgust on a
man who could have acted in so base a manner towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
his own countrymen. By the following lines
of Peter Langtoft, Siward appears to have had for
some time a private understanding with the <span class="locked">enemy:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“A knycht was tham among, Sir Richard Seward,<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="attrib">Vol. ii. p. 274&ndash;5.
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“For the performance of this agreement, hostages
were given to the English, and a messenger despatched
to acquaint Baliol that a truce had been
obtained; which he was instructed to say, was effected
entirely by the dexterity of Siward, and his
personal influence with a number of the English
nobles. Baliol was also advised to advance and
attack the English army while “at meat,” and
that, at the same time, Siward would make a sally
to assist him in destroying the enemy&mdash;which the
messenger spoke of as a matter of certainty, and
moreover counselled Baliol to proceed immediately
afterwards and plunder Northumberland.</p>

<p>“On the third day, Siward, from the battlements
of Dunbar, discovered the Scottish army rapidly
approaching towards him; he therefore hastily
sought the English head-quarters, and proffered
to go personally and retard the advance of the
Scots till the expiry of the time stipulated for by
the agreement. The English, however, were not
inclined to believe that he would carry his treason
quite so far, and refused him permission to proceed
to the Scottish <span class="locked">lines.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
“Siward, on being relieved from his confinement
in the Tower, rose high in the confidence of Edward.
On 26th September 1298, 7th May and
16th June 1299, he was summoned, by the title
“Baron,” to serve in Scotland. His name appears
on several occasions in the Wardrobe Account of
28th Edward I. In that year he received 41<i>l.</i> 5s.
for the services of himself and his followers in the
garrison of Lochmaben. Also an allowance of
2<i>l.</i> 13s. 4d. for the value of a horse killed at Kirkcudbright;
eight merks for a winter dress (robe);
and the like sum appears to have been paid to him
for a summer dress. In the same year he was
again summoned for the Scottish war, and also in
1301. He was made sheriff of Dumfries-shire in
1305, and was also aiding in the suppression of
Robert Bruce in 1308; in which year he was appointed
to the charge of a district in Galloway,
under Edward II. In 1309 he was governor or
constable of Dumfries, and is supposed to have
died in 1310.</p>

<p>By his wife Mary he had two sons, Richard and
John. They both attained the age of manhood;
and John, in particular, appears to have followed
the crooked anti-patriotic policy of his father. He
accompanied the Earl of Pembroke in his invasion
of Fife, as has been already mentioned, and was
rewarded by Edward with an appointment as Governor
of Perth. Little appears to have been
known of Richard. He was married to Elizabeth
&mdash;&mdash; in 1296. The arms of Siward, as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
been already noticed, were sable, a cross fleury,
argent.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Walter de Huntercombe</span> succeeded his father
in his lands in the 55. Henry III., at which
time he was of full age; and shortly afterwards
married Alice, third daughter and co-heiress of
Hugh de Bolebec, and who, in the 2d Edward I.,
was found to be one of the co-heirs of Richard de
Muntfichet, in right of her grandmother Margery,
his sister. In the 5th Edward I. he paid 50<i>l.</i>
for his relief of the barony of Muschamp; and
on the 12th December in that year, was summoned
to serve with horse and arms against the Welsh:
he received similar writs tested 6th April and 24th
May, 10th Edward I., and 14th June, 15th Edward
I. He was one of the peers who were present
in parliament in the 18th Edward I., when a
grant was made to the King, for the marriage of
his eldest daughter, of the same aid as had been
given to Henry III. for the marriage of his daughter
the Queen of Scotland; and shortly afterwards
the Isle of Man was intrusted to his charge, but
which he only held three years, as, in obedience
to the King’s commands, he surrendered his trust
to John de Baillol in the 21st Edward I. In the
19th Edward I., by writ tested the 16th April at
Darlington, he was ordered to be at Norham,
equipped for the field by the ensuing Easter; and
obtained a charter of free-warren in all his demesne
lands in the county of Northumberland before the
end of that year. On the 26th June 1294, Huntercombe
was ordered to join the expedition then
made into Gascony. His military services, during
the remainder of the reign of Edward I. were incessant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
for he was in the Scottish wars in the
25th, 26th, 28th, 31st, and 34th years of that
monarch; was Governor of Edinburgh Castle in
the 26th; Lieutenant of Northumberland in the
27th Edward I.; and afterwards Warden of the
Marches there. In the 28th Edward I. we find
that he was at the siege of Carlaverock; and in
the next year he was a party to the letter to Pope
Boniface, in which he is called “Walter Lord of
Huntercombe.” It appears from the Wardrobe
accounts of the 28th Edward I., that he was allowed
10<i>l.</i> as a compensation for a black nag
which was killed by the Scots at Flete, on the
6th August 1299. But the nature and extent of
Huntercombe’s services are best shown by his
own statement of them in his petition to the King
in the 35th Edward I., praying a remission of his
scutage for the expeditions in which he had been
engaged, with which prayer the crown complied.
He says, that he had been in all the wars of Scotland
up to that time; namely, in the first war at
Berwick with twenty horse; then at Stirling with
thirty-two horse, in the retinue of the Earl of
Warren; then at Le Vaire Chapelle with thirty
horse in the retinue of the Bishop of Durham;
afterwards at Gaway with sixteen horse; and that
he sent eighteen horse to the last battle, though
he was not present himself, being then Warden
of the Marches of Scotland and Northumberland.
From that year nothing more is known of this
Baron, excepting that he was summoned to parliament
from the 23d June, 23d Edward I., 1295,
to the 16th June, 14th Edward II., 1311, and
died in 1312; but after the 25th Edward I. he
was probably prevented by age from taking an active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
part in public affairs, for even allowing him
to have been but twenty-one in the 55th Henry
III., he must have been above sixty in 1307;
which calculation makes him to have been about
fifty when he was at Carlaverock, and sixty-four
at his decease. Though he was twice married he
died without issue. His first wife was Alice de
Bolebec, before mentioned; but we only know
that the Christian name of his second was Ellen,
and that she survived him. Nicholas Newbaud,
his nephew, son of his sister Gunnora, was found
to be his heir.</p>

<p>“The arms of Huntercombe were ermine, two
bars gemells, gules.”</p>

<span class="subhead">MEMOIR OF SIR SIMON FRASER.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_113">Page 113.</a></span></h2>

<p>This warrior appears to have been most actively
engaged in the battle of Roslin; and the renown
which has in consequence attached itself to his
name, will perhaps render the following notice of
him acceptable.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p><i>Simon de Fraser</i> was the eldest son of Simon de
Frazer, the ancestor of the baronial houses of Saltoun
and Lovat; and is supposed to have been a near connexion
of William Frazer, Bishop of St Andrew’s,
whose politics he appears in his early years to have
adopted; for, when he was taken prisoner on the
surrender of the castle of Dunbar in 1296, he
swore fealty to Edward, and remained faithful to
the English interest till 1302. He was repeatedly
summoned to fight against his countrymen, particularly
on 26th September 1298, and 7th May
1299. He also figured at the siege of Carlaverock
in 1300 as a Baron;&mdash;in the same year, he
was appointed Warden of the Forest of Selkirk,
and, by that designation, the truce between the
two countries was announced to him on the 30th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
October. In the same year, the sum of 64<i>l.</i> 18s.
is charged in the Wardrobe Account, as having
been paid him as the wages of himself and a retinue
of three knights and twelve esquires, from
13th July till 3d September, at which time his
horses were valued, and hire for 59 days allowed
him. There is also an allowance of 17<i>l.</i> 6s. 8d.
for the maintenance of his wife Lady Mary, her
daughters and family, living in the castle of Jedworth,
by the grant of the King, from Christmas
till St John Baptist’s day, 26 weeks, at a merk
per week, as per agreement with the Steward of
<span class="locked">Berwick-upon-Tweed.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span> On his withdrawing from
Edward, he joined Comyn, and gained the battle
of Roslin, as has already been observed. When
the English afterwards succeeded in subduing Scotland,
a severe penalty was inflicted upon him; he
was banished from all the territories belonging to,
or under the influence of England, for three years,
and his rents for that time forfeited. In 1306 he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
joined Bruce; but having unfortunately fallen into
the hands of the enemy, he was conveyed to
London and ordered by Edward for execution;&mdash;after
being drawn and quartered, his head was
fixed upon London Bridge. “But,” says Mr Nicholas,
“a much more minute and curious account
is given of the tragical termination of Frazer’s life
in a fragment of an inedited chronicle in the British
Museum of the 15th <span class="locked">century,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> from which
Mr Ritson printed the subjoined extract in illustration
of a poem which will be more fully noticed.</p>

<p>“The fryday next before assumpcioun of oure

<p>In one of the Harleian <span class="locked">manuscripts,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> there is
a ballad written on the subject, a few years after
the circumstance took place, and which was published
by <span class="locked">Ritson.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span> The following stanzas are so
extremely interesting, from the manner in which
Frazer is alluded to, that, notwithstanding the length
to which they extend, it is impossible to avoid inserting
them. After noticing the capture and the
fate of his unfortunate companions, the poet says:</p>

<p>Fraser left two daughters, his co-heirs, one of
whom married Sir Patrick Fleming, ancestor of
the Earls of Wigton; and the other named Mary,
was the wife of Sir Gilbert Hay, ancestor of the
Marquess of Tweedale. From Alexander Fraser
his brother the Barons Saltoun and Lovat descended.</p>

<p>The arms of Simon Frazer were, sable, semée
of roses argent; but the descendants of his brother

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
After this notice of so distinguished a leader
among the Scots, the reader may reasonably be
supposed to feel some curiosity respecting the
English general,</p>

<h3>SIR JOHN SEGRAVE.</h3>

<p>From the researches of Mr Nicolas, it appears
that this eminent Baron was the eldest son of
Nicholas Baron Segrave; and at his father’s death,
in the 23d Edward I., was thirty-nine years of
age. In the 54th Henry III., he married Christian,
daughter of Hugh de Plessets, knight, and
at the same time, his sister Amabil became the
wife of his brother-in-law, Sir John de Plessets.
Soon after the accession of Edward I., he was engaged
in the wars of Scotland, and in the 13th
Edward I. he attended the King in his expedition
into Wales. In the 19th Edward I. he was with
his father in the Scottish wars; and in the 24th
Edward I. executed the office of Constable of the
English army.</p>

<p>Dugdale asserts, that in the 25th Edward I.,
John de Segrave was, by indenture, retained to
serve Roger le Bigot, Earl of Norfolk, the Earl
Marshal, with six knights, including himself, as
well in peace as war, for the term of his whole
life, in England, Wales, and Scotland, with the
following retinue:&mdash;In time of peace, with six
horses, so long as the Earl should think fit, taking
<i>bouche of court</i> for himself and six knights; and
for his esquires hay and oats, together with livery
for six more horses, and wages for six grooms and
their horses. He was also to receive two robes
for himself, as for a banneret, yearly, as well in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
peace as in war, with the same robes for each of
his five knights, and two robes annually for his
other bachelors. In war, he was bound to bring
with him his five knights and twenty horses, in
consideration of which, he was to receive for himself
and his company, with all the said horses,
xl s. per diem; but if he should bring no more
than six horses, then xxij s. per diem. It was further
agreed, that the horses should be valued, in
order that proper allowance might be made, in
case any of them should happen to be lost in the
service; and, for the performance of this agreement,
he had a grant from the Earl of the manor
of Lodene in Norfolk.</p>

<p>The preceding document has been cited nearly
in Dugdale’s own words, because at the same time
that it affords much information with respect to
the retinue by which Segrave was attended to the
field, it proves that he was intimately connected
with the Earl Marshal, which tends to explain his
having in the same year, namely, on the 12th
August, 25th Edward I. 1297, been appointed by
the Earl to appear in his name before the King,
in obedience to a precept directed to him and the
Constable, commanding them to attend him on
the subject of a body of armed men which had
assembled in London. The record states, that on
the appointed day, the Earl of Hereford as Constable,
and “Mons<sup>r</sup> John de Segrave, qui excusa
le Comte Mareschal par maladie,” came <span class="locked">accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span>
In the 25th Edward I., this baron was
also summoned to accompany the King beyond
the sea, and afterwards at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
with horse and arms; and, in the next year, was
present when the English army gained the victory
of Falkirk. In the 28th Edward I., he was again
summoned to serve in the wars of Scotland, in
which year, when he must have been about forty-five
years old, he was at the siege of Carlaverock.
The account given of him by the poet, that he
performed the Earl Marshal’s duties upon that occasion,
because that nobleman was prevented from
attending, is not only strongly corroborated by
the preceding statement of his having acted as deputy
of the Earl Marshal in the year 1297, but
also by the following extract from Peter de Langtoft’s
chronicle (p. 309.), when speaking of the
expedition into Scotland in 1300.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“After Midesomers tide thorgh comon ordinance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No lenger suld thei bide, bot forth &amp; stand to chance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Norreis &amp; Surreis, that seruice auht the kyng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hors &amp; harneis at Carlele mad samnyng.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The erle Marschalle Rogere no hele that tyme mot haue,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To do alle tho service that longed the office tille,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&amp; mayntend alle the prise, ther he sauh lawe &amp; skille.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>After Carlaverock castle surrendered, Segrave’s
banner, from his having acted as Marshal during
the siege, was displayed on its battlements. In
the 30th of Edward I., he was a party to the Letter
from the Barons to the Pope, in which he is
styled “John Lord of Segrave;” and about that
time was appointed Governor of Berwick, and
Warden of Scotland. In the same year, whilst
riding out of Berwick with a small escort, he was
surprised by an ambuscade of the Scots, wounded,
and taken prisoner; which event is thus noticed
by Langtoft (p. 319.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Our men in Scotland with sautes sodeynly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Segrave myght not stand, Sir Jon tok the gayn stie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sonne &amp; his brother of bedde als thei woke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&amp; sextene knyghtes other, the Scottis alle them toke.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>His captivity was however, it appears, of short
duration; for, on Edward’s return to England, Segrave
was left as his Lieutenant of Scotland. At
different periods during the reign of Edward I., he
obtained grants of free warren and other privileges
in several of his manors, and possessed that elevated
place in his sovereign’s confidence and esteem,
which his long and zealous services so justly merited.
Nor was he less distinguished by his successor,
for soon after the accession of Edward II.,
he was constituted Governor of Nottingham castle,
which had belonged to Piers de Gaveston, and
was likewise appointed to his situation of Justice
of the Forests beyond the Trent, and Keeper of
all the Rolls thereto belonging; but he resigned
these offices in the following year, when they were
conferred upon Henry de Percy. In the 2d Edward
II., he was again appointed Warden of Scotland;
in the 6th Edward II. he was taken prisoner
at the battle of Bannockburn, and about twelve
months afterwards Thomas de Moram and several
other Scots, then prisoners in the Tower of
London, were delivered to Stephen de Segrave,
son and heir of the Baron, to be exchanged for him.
In the 8th Edward II., commissioners were appointed
to hear and determine all disputes relative to
the taking up of carriages by him or his agent, in
consequence of his offices of Keeper of the Forests
beyond the Trent, and of the castles of Nottingham
and Derby. He was summoned upon several occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
to serve in the Scottish wars during the early
part of the reign of Edward II., and to Parliament
from the 26th August, 24th Edward I., 1296, to
the 6th May, 18th Edward II., 1325. In the 10th
Edward II., in recompence of his great services,
and of his imprisonment in Scotland, he received
a grant of L.1000; but what was then due to the
crown for money received by him from the time of
his appointment of Warden of the Forests beyond
the Trent and Governor of Nottingham Castle,
was to be deducted from that sum.</p>

<p>The tide of royal favour at last turned, and he
accidentally fell a victim to the displeasure of his sovereign.
Having, in 1325, excited Edward’s anger
by the escape of Roger Lord Mortimer from
the Tower, he sent Segrave and the Earl of Kent
into Gascony, under the pretence of defending that
province, where he was attacked with a disease then
prevalent there, of which he shortly afterwards died,
aged about seventy years, leaving John de Segrave,
his grandson, son of his eldest son Stephen, who
died in his lifetime, his heir.</p>

<p>The preceding unadorned narrative of John de
Segrave’s services forms a splendid monument of
his fame: for, whilst the impossibility of colouring
the biography of his contemporaries with meretricious
ornaments of language, is strongly felt when
their actions are few or obscure, the absence of
such assistance tends to the advantage of those who
need no other eulogy than the simple record of the
occasions upon which they were present in the field,
or were selected to execute high and important
duties.</p>

<p>John de Segrave, the next Baron, added to the
honours of his ancestors in an unprecedented manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
by marrying Margaret, the daughter and heiress
of Thomas de Brotherton, Marshal of England,
younger son of King Edward I. Through the marriage
of Elizabeth, their daughter and heiress, with
John Lord Mowbray, that family attained the Marshalship
of England. The present representatives
of John Baron Segrave, the subject of this article,
are the Lords Stourton and Petre and the Earl of
Berkley. The arms of John de Segrave were sable,
a lion rampant, argent, crowned or.</p>

of the author; but that he has, at least, probability
on his side, may be inferred from the extraordinary

<p>“William Wallace, which had oft-times set
Scotland in great trouble, was taken and brought
to London, with great numbers of men and women
wondering upon him. <i>He was lodged in the
house of William Delect, a citizen of London, in
Fenchurch Street.</i> On the morrow, being the eve
of St Bartholomew, he was brought on horseback
to Westminster-hall; John Segrave and Geoffrey,
knights, the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen of London,
<i>many, both on horseback and on foot</i>, accompanying
him; and in the great hall at Westminster,
<i>he being placed on the south bench</i>, crowned
with laurel, for that he had said in times past that
he ought to wear a crown in that hall, as it was
commonly reported; and being appeached as a
traitor by Sir Peter Malorie, the King’s Justice,
he answered <i>that he was no traitor to the King
of England</i>; but for other things whereof he was
accused, he confessed them, and was, after, headed
and quartered.”&mdash;<i>Stow. Chron.</i> p. 209.</p>

<p>“Thus did Edward glut his vengeance on the
dead body of this worthy man, whose living soul
all his power never could subdue.</p>

<p>“Some of the English historians have stained
their pages with low invectives against Wallace.
Carte, in particular [Hist. v. ii. p. 290.], labours
hard to prove him a traitor to King Edward, whose
<i>mercy</i> he praises. That he was a traitor, he proves
from his being a native of Galloway, <i>or</i> the Cambrian
territories, which, <i>he says</i>, the kings of Scotland
held in vassalage of the crown of England,
and because the subvassals were, in cases of rebellion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
subject by the feudal law to the same forfeitures
and penalties as the immediate vassal.</p>

<p>“A man must feel himself very much pinched
for arguments, when he has recourse to such as are
confessedly not founded on reason, and to quibbles
and perversion of facts. Clydesdale, the ancient
kingdom of Strathcluyd, one of the first independent
kingdoms established in Britain by the expulsion
of the Romans, which for many centuries withstood
the attacks of the Angles, Pichts, Scots, and Norwegians,
and had the honour to produce <span class="smcap">Stewart</span>,
<span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, and <span class="smcap">Walays</span>, was never pretended to
be any part of the territories of which the kings
of England claimed the superiority. So the pretence
that Walays was a traitor, in consequence of
the place of his birth, falls to the ground; and the
pretence of rebellion is equally unfounded, unless
the noble exertions of a free people against the
unjustifiable attempts of a neighbouring prince to
subject them to his dominion, are to be branded
with the name of rebellion. Well may the spirit
of the noble Walays forgive those writers for accusing
him of inhumanity and rebellion, who have
extolled the clemency of Edward I.”&mdash;<i>Notes to
Wyntoun’s Chronicle</i>, vol. ii. p. 503.</p>

<p>The inclination to detract from the merits of
Wallace, does not appear to have become entirely
extinct among the historians of England. Dr Lingard
thus expresses himself respecting our hero:
“It may perhaps offend the national partiality of
some among my readers, but I greatly suspect that
Wallace owes his celebrity as much to his execution
as to his exploits. Of all the Scottish
chieftains who deserved and experienced the enmity
of Edward, he alone perished on the gallows;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
and on this account his fate called forth and monopolized
the sympathy of his countrymen.”&mdash;Vol. iii.
p. 227.</p>

<p>On this Mr Tytler remarks, “It is not true, that
of all the Scottish chieftains who deserved Edward’s
enmity, Wallace was the only one who perished
on the gallows. Sir Nigel Bruce, Sir Christopher
Seton, John Seton, the Earl of Athol, Sir Simon
Fraser, Sir Herbert de Morham, Thomas Boys,
Sir David Inchmartin, Sir John de Somerville, Sir
Thomas and Sir Alexander Bruce, both brothers
of the king, and Sir Reginald Crawfurd, were all
hanged by Edward’s orders in the course of the
year 1306, within a year of the execution of Wallace.
So much for the accuracy of the ground on
which Lingard has founded his conjecture, that
Wallace owes his celebrity ‘to his execution.’”</p>

<p>Respecting the inaccuracies of Dr Lingard on
this subject, we shall give another extract from the
same authority. “He,” Dr Lingard “observes,
that after the surprise of Ormesby the Justiciary,
by Wallace and Douglas, other independent chieftains
arose in different counties, who massacred
the English, and compelled their own countrymen
to fight under their standards. These other independent
chieftains are brought in ‘for the nonce’
by Dr Lingard. They are utterly unknown to
the contemporary historians, English and Scottish.
But they do not appear upon the stage without a
use. On the contrary, they first multiply like Falstaff’s
men in buckram, ‘into numerous parties,’
and then act a principal part in the next sentence;
for the historian goes on to observe, ‘that the origin
and progress of <i>these numerous parties</i> had been
viewed with secret satisfaction by the Steward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Scotland, and Wishart the Bishop of Glasgow,
who determined to collect them into one body,
and to give their efforts one common direction.
Declaring themselves the assertors of Scottish independence,
they invited the different leaders to
rally around them; and the summons was obeyed
by Wallace and Douglas, by Sir Alexander Lindsay,
Sir Andrew Moray, and Sir Richard Lundy,’
vol. iii. p. 305. This last sentence is one of pure
and gratuitous invention, without a shadow of historical
authority to support it. The numerous
and independent parties and chieftains who rose in
different counties&mdash;the silent satisfaction with which
they were contemplated by the Bishop of Glasgow
and the High Steward&mdash;their determination to
collect them into one body, and to give them one
common direction&mdash;their declaring themselves the
assertors of Scottish independence&mdash;their summons
to the different leaders to rally round them, and
the prompt obedience of this summons by Wallace,
Douglas, and the rest&mdash;are facts created by
the ingenuity of the historian. They seem to be
introduced for the purpose of diminishing the reputation
of Wallace; and the impression they leave
on the mind of the reader, appears to me to be
one totally different from the truth. The Steward
and the Bishop of Glasgow are the patriot chiefs
under whom Douglas and Wallace, and many
other independent chieftains consent to act for the
recovery of Scottish freedom; and Wallace sinks
down into the humble partisan, whose talents are
directed by their superior authority and wisdom.
Now, the fact is exactly the reverse of this. The
Steward and Wishart, encouraged by the successes
of Wallace and Douglas, joined their party, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
acted along with them in their attempt to free
Scotland; but neither Fordun, nor Wynton, nor
Bower gives us the slightest ground to think that
they acted a principal part, or any thing like a
principal part, in organizing the first rising against
Edward. On the contrary, these historians, along
with Trivet and Walsingham, Tyrrel and Carte,
ascribe the rising to Wallace alone, whose early
success first caused him to be joined by Douglas,
and afterwards by the Bishop and the Steward,
along with Lindsay, Moray, and Lundy. Indeed,
instead of playing the part ascribed to him by Lingard,
the patriotism of the Steward and the Bishop,
was of that lukewarm and short-lived kind
which little deserves the name. It did not outlive
eight weeks; and they seized the first opportunity
to desert Wallace and the cause of freedom.
The attack upon Ormesby the Justiciary took
place some time in May 1297; and on the 9th of
July of the same year, did Bishop Wishart, this
patriot assertor of Scottish independence, negociate
the treaty of Irvine, by which he and the other
Scottish barons, with the single exception of Wallace
and Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, submitted
to Edward. Lingard’s other hero, the High
Steward, who is brought in to divide the glory
with Wallace, was actually in the English service
at the battle of Stirling; and although he secretly
favoured the Scottish cause, he did not openly
join his countrymen till he saw the entire destruction
of Surrey’s army. I may remark, in concluding
this note, that the idea of an attack upon Wallace,
and an eulogy on the clemency of Edward,
has probably not even the merit of originality. It
appears to be borrowed from Carte, vol. ii. p. 290;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
but it is only the idea which is taken. The clumsy
and absurd argument of Carte is discarded, and a
far more ingenious hypothesis, with a new set of
facts, is substituted in its place. On reading over
Hemingford again, I find one expression which
may perhaps have suggested this theory of Lingard.
Hemingford says, speaking of Bruce, p. 120,
that he joined the Bishop of Glasgow and the
Steward, ‘qui tocius mali fabricatores exstiterant.’
Yet this is inconsistent with his own account
in p. 118, and is not corroborated, so far as
I know, by any other historian.”</p>

<p>Among other singular passages in the work of
the learned Doctor, we cannot omit taking notice
of the following: “The only great battles in
which Wallace is known to have fought, are
those of Stirling and Falkirk. In the first he
was victorious; but he must share the glory
of the action with Sir Andrew Murray, who
was certainly his equal in command, perhaps his
superior. In the second he was defeated, and
the defeat was the most disastrous that Scotland
ever experienced. In the history of the next five
years, his name is scarcely ever mentioned.” Scottish
historians never pretended that there was
any battle of equal importance to those of Stirling
and Falkirk, in which Wallace was engaged. But
where Dr Lingard could get his information, that
Sir Andrew Murray held a superior, or even an
<i>equal command</i> with him, it is not easy to conjecture.
In Scottish authors, evidences to the contrary
are innumerable; and if Dr Lingard had not
preferred substituting his own “perhaps,” in place
of historical record, he might have proofs in direct
opposition to the statement he has made, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
even from English authors, with whom he appears
to be familiar.</p>

<p>At the treaty of Irvine, for the submission of
the Scottish barons, when all deserted Wallace
but Sir Andrew Murray, it is mentioned in the
instrument as having been notified to Wallace
“Escrit à Sire Willaume,” and the name of Sir
Andrew is not even alluded to. This would certainly
not have been the case, had he held even an
equal command, much less a superior.&mdash;<i>Fœdera,
T.</i> ii. p. 774.</p>

<p>In the Chronicle of Langtoft, page 297, we have
an account of the battle of Stirling, which is thus
<span class="locked">introduced:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The rascail of ther route bigan to werre alle newe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thorgh fals concelement William did his wille,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our castels has he brent, our men slayn fulle ille.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The chronicler, after telling us that Wallace was
the <i>head and justice of the Scots</i>&mdash;expressions
which embrace a pretty extensive prerogative&mdash;proceeds
to narrate the operations of the day, in
which he speaks of Wallace as the only commander
opposed to Warren: nor does he even hint of
any individual who had a right to “divide the glory”
of the victory with him: on the contrary he says,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The Inglis were alle slayn, the Scottis bare them wele,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Waleis had the wayn, als maistere of that eschele.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Sir Andrew Murray is not even mentioned by
Langtoft. That he fought bravely, and died nobly
in defence of his country, is what no one will
attempt to deny, and the same might be said of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
many more who were present on that occasion;
but being the only man amongst a timid and backsliding
aristocracy, who acted with patriotism and
spirit in so trying a time, his name has been handed
down to the grateful remembrance of posterity.</p>

<p>“In the next five years,” adds Dr Lingard,
the “name” of Wallace “is scarcely ever mentioned.”
When Scottish affairs are concerned,
and more particularly when the character of her
deliverer is the subject adverted to, a reference to
authorities appears to be extremely irksome, or attended
with too much trouble to our learned author.
In the present instance, however, we shall
not ask him to go farther than the pages of his
own work, where he will find matter that might
lead him to suspect the truth of the above assertion,
as well as the correctness of the view he has
taken of the grounds on which our patriot’s popularity
is founded. We are informed (vol. iii.
p. 227), “The only man whose enmity could give
him” (Edward) a “moment’s uneasiness, was Wallace,
and in few months he was brought captive
to London.” And again, vol. iii. p. 329, “If the
fate of Wallace was different from all others, it
proves that there was something peculiar in his
case which rendered him less deserving of mercy.”
If we are to credit our author’s statements, Edward
must have been a more nervous character than he has
ever been supposed to be, if he could feel “uneasiness”
at “the enmity” of a man who had been thus
buried in obscurity, and whose “name had scarcely
been heard of for five years,”&mdash;one who, in the
only great battle in which he was successful, held
but a subordinate command, and acted during the
insurrection in the humble character of a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
partisan, under the direction of others. Surely
there was nothing peculiarly aggravating in the
case of such a man, to have “rendered him less deserving
of mercy” than his more guilty superiors,
particularly from <i>one</i> whom our author informs us
“was <i>not</i> a blood-thirsty tyrant.” It is strange
that it did not appear to Dr Lingard, as a very
high degree of praise, that after Wallace had been
deprived, by the severe and sanguinary policy of
Edward, of all resources save what arose from his
own dauntless heart and irresistible arm, that he
should still continue to be the only man <i>whose</i>
“enmity” could give the oppressor of his country
“a moment’s uneasiness.” From this circumstance,
and from this alone, arose that “something
peculiar” in his case which rendered him obnoxious
to the tender mercies of Edward. In conclusion,
we cannot help remarking, that the Doctor’s
method of substituting, where his prejudices
happen to be interested, his own theoretical conjectures,
in opposition to the authentic records of
the country, is rather an indirect way to the confidence
of his reader.</p>

<p>From the following passage in the Minstrel it
would seem, that a portrait of Wallace had been
taken during his short stay in France, and forwarded
to his friends in Scotland. What afterwards
became of this precious relic, cannot now
be discovered. Though there are many likenesses
of him to be met with in the country, yet the
pretensions to originality of all those we have yet
seen, are extremely questionable. It would be
difficult for a blind man to give his ideas of a picture
in more appropriate language than the following.</p>

<span class="subhead">REMINISCENCE OF WALLACE.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_163">Page 163.</a></span></h2>

<p>Among the few speeches of Wallace which we
have on record, the following is mentioned by
English writers, as having been addressed by him
to the Scottish schiltrons, on the eve of the battle
of Falkirk:&mdash;“I haif brocht you to the ring, hap
gif you cun.” Respecting the meaning of these
words, however, there is no agreement between
Scottish or English writers. Walsingham has it,
“I haif brocht you to the King, hop gif you
cun;”&mdash;on which Lord Hailes very properly <span class="locked">remarks:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“This speech of Wallace has generally been
related and explained in a sense very different. I
must therefore give my reasons for having departed
so widely from the common opinion. <i>Walsingham</i>,
p. 75, says, ‘Dicens eis patriâ linguâ,&mdash;<i>I
haif brocht you to the</i> King, <i xml:lang="cel" lang="cel">hop gif you cun</i>.’
This short speech has always appeared to me as
utterly inconsistent with the character of Wallace.
It is commonly understood to mean, ‘I have
brought you to the King, hope if you can hope.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
To say nothing of the impropriety of the appellation
of <i>King</i>, bestowed by Wallace on Edward,
the sentiment, ‘hope, if you can hope,’ seems
only fit for the mouth of a coward or a traitor.
Abercrombie, perceiving this, has given a more
plausible interpretation of the word <i>hop</i>. He renders
the phrase thus, ‘<i>Fly</i> if you can;’ as if
Wallace had meant to say, ‘<i>Fight</i>, for you cannot
fly.’ There is nothing incongruous in this
sentiment; but surely it did not merit to be recorded:
Neither was it strictly true; for the Scottish
army might have retired with unbroken forces
into the forest which lay in the rear. The only
satisfactory interpretation of Wallace’s address to
his troops, is to be found in <i>W. Westm.</i> p. 451,
‘<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ecce adduxi vos ad <i>annulum</i> charolate (chorolate)
sive tripudiate vos, sicut melius scitis</span>.’
<i>King</i>, in Walsingham, ought to be <i>ring</i>. The
words of Wallace were, ‘I haif brocht you to the
ring, hap gif you cun.’ <i>The ring</i> means the
dance <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la ronde</i>. <i>Douglas</i> translates ‘Exercet
Diana <i>choros</i>,’ Æneid ii., thus, ‘Ledand <i>ring-dances</i>,’
p. 28. l. 42. ‘Te lustrare <i>choros</i>,’
Æneid vii., thus: ‘To the scho led <i>ring-sangis</i>
in karoling,’ p. 220, l. 31. Elsewhere, in his
own person, he says, ‘Sum sang <i>ring-sangis</i>,’
Prologue, xii. B. p. 402, l. 33. That <i>hap</i> or <i>hop</i> is
understood of dancing, is also plain from <i>Douglas</i>.
He thus paraphrases ‘Hic exultantes Salios,’
Æneid, viii.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">‘The dansand Preistis, clepit <i>Salii</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Happand</i> and singand.’ P. 267, l. 21.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“I need not prove, that ‘gif you cun’ implies
‘if you have skill,’ or, ‘according to your skill.’
The verb is obsolete; but the noun and the adjective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
are still remembered. ‘Let my right hand
forget its <i>cunning</i>,’ ‘a <i>cunning</i> artificer,’ ‘a <i>cunning</i>
man.’ <i>Langtoft</i>, vol. ii. p. 305, as translated
by Brunne, reports the words thus: “To the
renge ere ye brouht, hop now if ye wille.” But
he does not seem to have understood the import
of the words.”</p>

<p>The above is all learned enough; but his lordship
has stopped short in his explanation, and left
his readers as much in the dark, as any of his predecessors,
respecting the meaning or propriety of such
a phrase in the mouth of a general, on the commencement
of a great battle. Some of our readers perhaps
require to be told that <i>schiltron</i> means a body of
men drawn up in a <span class="locked">circle.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> The war-dance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Scots and other northern nations, as is well known,
was performed round a large fire. Each warrior’s
hand was firmly clasped in that of his neighbour.
Their motion was at first slow, and gradually increased,
till their rapidity almost rivalled the velocity
of the whirlwind. When arrived at this state
of fury, if any luckless wight slipped his hold,
or otherwise became unsteady, the impetus which
he and his fellows had acquired, pitched him headlong
amid the flames, when his endeavours to extricate
himself from the blaze, and regain his place,
formed the chief sport of his companions. To
render the schiltron the most formidable figure for
defensive operations, steadiness was all that was
requisite. When Wallace, therefore, on the rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
advance of the English, addressed his soldiers
in the manner alluded to, he gave utterance to the
happiest thought, in the fewest words, that perhaps
ever presented itself to the mind of genius in
a case of emergency. The striking similarity between
their form of battle and their favourite dance,
was apparent to all; and the impending conflict
became instantly stript of its terrors, by a playful
allusion to an amusement with which they were
familiar, while it flashed upon their minds with all
the conviction of experience, that on the preservation
of their ranks their safety depended. The
behaviour of the schiltrons on that fatal day showed
that they understood the address of their leader
better than any of its subsequent commentators.</p>

<span class="subhead">WALLACE’S DESCENDANTS.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_167">Page 167.</a></span></h2>

<p>Wallace appears to have left a daughter, whose
legitimacy has been called in question, but on very
slender grounds. In Chalmers’s Caledonia, vol. i.
p. 579, we find the following passage:&mdash;“It has
been said that Wallace left no legitimate issue;
but he had a natural daughter, who married Sir
William Baillie of Hoprig, the progenitor of the
Baillies of Lamington.” It has never been disputed,
that the lady by whom Wallace had this
daughter was the heiress of Lamington, in right
of her father, Sir Hew de Bradfute; it would
therefore have been satisfactory, if the learned author
above mentioned had explained how the Baillies
of Hoprig came to the possession of Lamington.
If the daughter of Wallace was legitimate
their succession appears the natural consequence
of the marriage of Sir William Baillie; if not, the
manner in which they became possessed of that
property requires elucidation. That Wallace and
the heiress of Lamington were lawfully married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
is asserted by Henry, who draws the following
picture of their connubial <span class="locked">happiness:&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>According to the above authority, the offspring
of this marriage was first united in the bands of
wedlock to an Esquire of the name of Shaw.
Whether this was any connection of William de
Shaw, mentioned at page 106, vol. i. of this work,
as witnessing the charter of James, Lord High
Steward of Scotland, along with some other friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
of Wallace, we have no means of ascertaining.
We are told, however, that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Rycht gudly men come off this lady ying.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether these were the issue of the marriage
with Shaw, or of that afterwards contracted
with Baillie of Hoprig, or of both, it
is difficult to determine. It is probable, as Sir
William Baillie is designated, of Hoprig, and his
descendants as proprietors of Lamington, that they
may have succeeded to the inheritance, after the
offspring of the first marriage had become extinct.
It has also been advanced, as an argument against
the legitimacy of the daughter of Wallace, that
she inherited none of the property of her father.
Those, however, who started this objection, would
have done well to have shown, that Wallace possessed
property to which she could have succeeded.
It does not appear that he was ever personally
invested in any of the lands belonging to the
family. And mention is made of his brother
Malcolm having left a son of the name of John,
in whom the succession was prolonged, till it
merged in the family of Craigie. In Langtoft’s
Chronicle, vol. ii. p. 338, we have an account of
the capture and execution of a Sir John de Wallace,
who is there called a brother of Sir William.
This is evidently a mistake, and might very easily
arise from the closeness of the connection between
the two parties. Another “John Walays of Elryslà”
(Elderslie) is taken notice of as among
the witnesses to the charter of Robert, Duke of
Albany; and, from the family title being preserved,
it is highly probable that the stock of Sir Malcolm
Wallace had not then become extinct.</p>

<span class="subhead">ON THE TREACHERY OF MENTEITH.</span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_169">Page 169.</a></span></h2>

<p>In the account of the capture of Wallace, we have
thought it advisable to follow, in a great measure,
the statement given by the Minstrel. It is,
we conceive, the only rational one we are possessed
of; and as the authority of the author has been
supported by the Tower records, and other incontrovertible
muniments, in matters of comparatively
trifling importance, it would be unfair to doubt
his veracity on so important a part of the history
of his hero, particularly when all the notices we
have in other writers, tend more or less to confirm
the truth of what he asserts. Lord Hailes, however,
has attempted to remove the odium which
has for these five hundred years been attached to
the memory of Menteith; but his efforts to exculpate
the Judas of Scotland, have been viewed
by the generality of his countrymen in rather an
unfavourable light. In the remarks his Lordship
has made on the subject, we cannot discover that
acuteness which frequently appears in his other
writings. Dr Jamieson has thus replied to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
“The account given of the treachery of Menteth,
is one of those points on which Sir D. Dalrymple
shows his historical scepticism. He introduces
it in language calculated to inspire doubt
into the mind of the reader; observing, that ‘the
popular tradition is, that his <i>friend</i>, Sir John Menteth,
betrayed him to the English.’&mdash;<i>Annals</i>, i.
281. It is rather strange that he should express
himself in this manner, at the very moment that
he quotes the Scotichronicon on the margent; as if
this venerable record, when a modern should be
disposed to adopt a theory irreconcileable with its
testimony, were entitled to no higher regard than
is due to ‘popular tradition.’</p>

<p>“He adds,’Sir John Menteth was of high
birth, a son of Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteth.’
I can perceive no force in this remark, unless it be
meant to imply that there never has been an instance
of a man of noble blood acting the part of
a traitor. On the same ground, we might quarrel
with all the evidence given of the conspiracies
formed against Robert Bruce; and even call in
question the murder of that amiable and accomplished
prince, James I.</p>

<p>“But ‘at this time,’ we are told, ‘the important
fortress of Dumbarton was committed to
his (Menteith’s) charge by Edward.’ Here, it
would seem, the learned writer fights the poor
Minstrel with his own weapons. For I find no
evidence of this fact in the Fœdera, Hemingford,
or the Decem Scriptores; and Lord Hailes has referred
to no authority; so that there is reason to
suspect, to use his own language, that he here
‘copies’ what ‘is said by <i>Blind Harry</i>, whom
no historian but Sir Robert Sibbald will venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
to <i>quote</i>.’ If Harry’s narrative be received as authority,
it is but justice to receive his testimony
as he gives it. Now, in the preceding part of his
work, he represents Menteth as holding the castle
of Dunbarton at least with the consent of Wallace,
while acknowledged as governor of Scotland.
It would appear, indeed, that the whole district of
the Lennox had been intrusted to him.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“In the Leynhouss a quhill he maid repayr;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Schyr Jhon Menteth that tym was captane thar.”<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="attrib">B. viii. 1595.
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“But even at this time there was something dubious
in the conduct of Menteth. While he retained
the castle, the English held the town under
Edward.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“In peess thai duelt, in trubyll that had beyn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trewbut payit till Ingliss capdanis keyn.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In thar supplé to be in all his mycht.”<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="attrib">B. ix. 1393.
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“It is perfectly conceivable, that, although it was
known to Wallace that Menteth had some secret
understanding with the English, this artful man
might persuade him that he only wished an opportunity
of wreaking the national vengeance on
them, or at least of more effectually serving the
interest of Wallace when he saw the proper time.
Although Wallace had been assured that Menteith
had taken an oath of fealty to Edward, he would
have had no more reason for distrusting him than
for distrusting by far the greatest part of the nobility
and landholders of Scotland, who, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
believed, from the necessity of despair had submitted
to the usurper.</p>

<p>“John de Menteth is designated by Arnold Blair,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">immanis proditor</i>; and the writer proceeds to curse
him as if with bell, book, and candle.&mdash;<i>Relations</i>,
p. 8.</p>

<p>“Sir David aims another blow at this account, in
the following words;&mdash;‘That he had ever any intercourse
of friendship or familiarity with Wallace,
I have yet to learn.’ But the truth is, the worthy
Judge does not seem disposed to <i>learn</i> this.
It is difficult to say what evidence will satisfy him.
The incidental hints, in the preceding part of the
poem, in regard to Wallace’s connection with Menteth,
all perfectly agree with the mournful termination.
Such confidence had he in him, according
to the Minstrel, that he not only resided in Dunbarton
Castle for two months, while Menteth had
the charge of it, but gave orders for building ‘a
house of stone’ there, apparently that he might
enjoy his society.</p>

of Menteith with Wallace, Graham, and Scrymgeour,
in the suppression of the rebellious men of
Galloway. ‘In hoc ipso anno (1298), viz. xxviii.
die mensis Augusti, dominus Wallas Scotiæ custos,
cum Johanne Grhame et <i>Johanne de Menteth</i>, militibus,
necnon Alexandro Scrimzeour constabulario
villæ de Dundee, et vexillario Scotiæ, cum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
quinquagentis militibus armatis, rebelles Gallovidienses
punierunt, qui regis Angliæ et Cuminorum
partibus sine aliquo jure steterunt.’</p>

<p>“These words, which seem to be a quotation, in
the Relationes of Blair, from the Scotichronicon,
are not found in the MSS. from which Goodall
gave his edition. They appear to have formed
the commencement of the xxxii. chapter of the
eleventh book, one of the two chapters here said
to be wanting. Now this, whether it be the language
of Bower, or of Blair, could not have been
borrowed from the Minstrel, for the circumstance
is overlooked by him. It seems to refer to that
period of the history of Wallace, in which he is
said to have made a circuit through Galloway and
Carrick.</p>

<p>“It is to be observed, that John Major expressly
affirms the treachery of Menteth, as acting in
concert with Aymer de Valloins, Earl of Pembroke.
He says, that Menteth was considered as his most
intimate friend; ‘ipsi Vallacco putatus amicissimus.’
Hist. Fol. lxxiii. Now, although he rejects many
of the transactions recited by Blind Harry ‘as
false,’ so far is he from insinuating the slightest
hesitation as to this business, that he formally
starts an objection as to the imprudence of Wallace
in not being more careful of his person, and
answers it by remarking, that ‘no enemy is more
dangerous than a domestic one.’ He differs from
the Minstrel in saying that Wallace was ‘captured
<i>in</i> the city of Glasgow.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
“It may be added, that Bower expressly asserts
that Wallace, ‘suspecting no evil, was fraudulently
and treacherously seized <i>at</i> Glasgow by
Lord John de Menteth.’ <i>Scotichron.</i> xii. 8.
Bower again refers to the treacherous conduct of
Menteth towards Wallace when afterwards relating
a similar plan which he had laid for taking
King Robert Bruce prisoner, under pretence of delivering
up to him the Castle of Dunbarton, on
condition of his receiving a hereditary right to the
lieutenancy of the Lennox; v. Lib. xii. c. 16, 17,
Vol. ii. 243. These two chapters are not in all
the MSS., but are found in those of Cupar, Perth,
and Dunblane. Now, Bower was born anno
1385; <i>Ibid.</i> ii. 401. The date assigned to the
Scotichronicon, as published with his Continuation,
is 1447, and that to the Minstrel’s Poem,
1470; v. Pinkerton’s Maitland Poems, Intr. lxxxvi&ndash;lxxxix.
It is therefore impossible that Bower
could have borrowed the account given of Menteth
from Blind Harry. Bower was born, indeed, only
eighty or eighty-one years after the fact referred
to; and, considering the elevation of the character of
Wallace, and the great attachment of his countrymen
even to this day, as well as the multitude of
his enemies, it is totally inconceivable that a whole
nation, learned and unlearned, should concur in
imputing this crime to one man, <i>without</i> the most
valid reasons.</p>

<p>“Wyntown finished his ‘<i>Cronykil</i>,’ anno 1418.
He, it is generally believed, was born little more than
fifty years after the butchery of our magnanimous
patriot. Sir David Dalrymple could not, one
would suppose, reasonably object to his testimony.
Let us hear it.</p>

<p>“I shall only add an important proof from the
Lanercost MS., referred to in the <i>Preliminary
Remarks</i>.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> ‘<i>Captus</i> fuit Willelmus Waleis per
unum Scottum, scilicet per dominum Johannem de
Mentiphe, et usque London ad Regem adductus,
et adjudicatum fuit quod traheretur, et suspenderetur,
et decollaretur, et membratim divideretur, et
quod viscera ejus comburentur, quod factum est; et
suspensum est caput ejus super pontem London,
armus autem dexter super pontem Novi Castri super
Tynam, et armus sinister apud Berwicum, pes
autem dexter apud villam Sancti Johannis, et pes
sinister apud Aberden.’ Fol. 211. <i>Mentiphe</i> is
obviously an <i>erratum</i> for <i>Menteith</i>.”</p>

<p>Mr Tytler, in the “Notes and Illustrations” to
the first volume of his History of Scotland, has
also handled this subject with considerable ability.
We shall select the following, as affording additional
arguments to those already advanced by Dr
Jamieson. In alluding to the evidence afforded
by the Lanercost MS., that intelligent writer observes,
“We cannot be surprised that Lord Hailes
should have been ignorant of this passage, as he
tells us, Annals, vol. ii. p. 316, he had not been
able to discover where the MS. of Lanercost was
preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
“The same excuse, however, will not avail
him as to the next piece of evidence, of Menteth’s
having seized Wallace. It is contained in Leland’s
extract from an ancient MS. Chronicle, which
Hailes has elsewhere quoted; I mean the Scala
Chronicle, preserved in Corpus Christi Library,
Cambridge. In Leland’s Collect., vol. i. p. 541,
we have this passage from the Chronicle. ‘<i>Wylliam
Waleys was taken of the Counte of Menteth
about Glaskow</i>, and sent to King Edward, and after
was hangid, drawn, and quarterid at London.’
This is only Leland’s abridgment of the passage,
which in all probability is much more full and satisfactory
in the original. Yet it is quite satisfactory
as to Menteth’s guilt.</p>

<p>“The next English authority is Langtoft’s Chronicle,
which Hailes has himself quoted in his
Notes and Corrections, vol. ii. p. 346. It is curious,
and as to Menteith’s guilt perfectly conclusive.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">He was the encheson, that Sir Jon so him nam.’ p. 329.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“We learn from this, that Sir John Menteth prevailed
upon Wallace’s servant, Jack Short, to betray
his master, and came under cover of night,
and seized him in bed, ‘his leman bi,’ and when
he had no suspicion of what was to happen. How
Hailes, after quoting this passage, which was written
more than two centuries before Blind Harry,
should have represented this poor minstrel as the
only original authority for the guilt of Menteth,
is indeed difficult to determine.”</p>

<p>“Having given these authorities, all of them prior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
to Blind Harry, it is unnecessary to give the testimony
of the more modern writers. The ancient
writers prove incontestably, that Sir John de Menteth,
a Scottish baron, who had served along with
and under Wallace against the English, deserted
his country, swore homage to Edward, and employed
a servant of Wallace to betray his master
into his hands; that he seized him in bed, and delivered
him to Edward, by whom he was instantly
tried, condemned, and hanged. It was natural that
the voice of popular tradition should continue from
century to century, to execrate the memory of
such a man. Whether Menteth was the intimate
friend of Wallace, or what precise degree of familiarity
existed between them, it is now not easy
to determine, nor is it of any consequence as to his
guilt. Indeed it is impossible to regard, without
a smile the weak and inconclusive evidence, if it
deserves so grave a name, on which Hailes has
founded what he calls his Apology for Menteth,
which, after all, seems to be borrowed from <i>Carte,
vol. ii. p. 289</i>. Lord Hailes also remarks, “It is
most improbable, that Wallace should have put
himself in the power of a man whom he knew to
be in an office of distinguished trust under Edward;”
and almost in the same breath paraphrases the lines
of Langtoft, in which it is stated that his capture
was effected through the treason of Jack Short,
whose brother Wallace is said to have slain.
Surely the confidence was as imprudent in the one
case as it would have been in the other. It may
be observed, however, that if there had been a
possibility of rescuing the name of Menteith from
the execrations of his country, the task would not
have remained for the learned annalist to perform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
The great family interest which he possessed, was
sufficient to protect him from punishment, not only
for his treachery to Wallace, but also for his subsequent
perfidy to Bruce. Yet though that interest
was powerfully exerted to screen him from
the consequences of his demerits, not a single effort
was made to remove the dishonourable stain
from his character.</p>

<p>The following transaction, which has already
been alluded to, is quite consistent with the conduct
ascribed to him by the Minstrel. It will also
account for the impunity which attended his
crimes.</p>

<p>“About this time, there happened a passage
not unworthy to be related, in regard to the variety
of providences, in a narrow compass of time.
John Menteith, who betrayed his friend Wallace
to the English, and was therefore deservedly hated
by the Scots, received, amongst other rewards,
the government of Dumbarton castle from the
English. When other forts were recovered, that
only, or but very few with it, held out for the
English. And because it was naturally impregnable,
the king dealt with the governor, by his friends
and kindred, to surrender it. He demanded the
county or earldom of Lennox, as the price of his
treachery and surrender. Neither would he ever
so much as hear of any other terms. In this case
the King wavered and fluctuated in his mind what
to do. On the one side, he earnestly desired to
have the castle; yet, on the other, he did not so
much prize it, as for its sake to disoblige the Earl
of Lennox, who had been his fast and almost his
only friend in all his calamities. But the Earl of
Lennox hearing of it, and coming in, soon decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the controversy, and persuaded the King, by all
means to accept the condition. Accordingly the
bargain was made as John Monteith would have
it, and solemnly confirmed. But when the King
was going to take possession of the castle, a carpenter,
one Roland, met him in the wood of Colquhoun,
about a mile from it; and having obtained
liberty to speak with the King, concerning a
matter of great importance, he told him what
treachery the governor intended against him; nay,
and had prepared to execute it. It was this:&mdash;In a
wine-cellar concealed, and underground, a sufficient
number of Englishmen were hid, who, when the
rest of the castle should be given up, and the King
secure, were to issue forth upon him as he was at
dinner, and either to kill, or take him prisoner.
This being thus related, the King, upon the surrender
of the other parts of the castle by John, being
kindly invited to a feast, refused to eat; till, as he
had searched all other parts of the castle; so, he
had viewed that wine-cellar also. The governor
excused it, pretending that the smith, who had the
key, was out of the way, but that he would come
again anon. The King, not satisfied therewith,
caused the door to be broke open, and so the plot
was discovered. The Englishmen were brought
forth in their armour, and being severally examined,
confessed the whole matter; and they added
also another discovery, viz. that a ship rode ready
in the next bay to carry the King into England,
The complices in this wretched design were put
to death; but John was kept in prison, because
the King was loth to offend his kindred, and especially
his sons-in-law, in so dangerous a time: for
he had many daughters, all of them very beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
and married to men rich enough, but factious. Therefore,
in a time of such imminent danger, the battle
drawing near wherein all was at stake, lest the
mind of any powerful man might be rendered averse
from him, and thereby inclined to practise
against him, John was released out of prison, upon
this condition, (for the performance whereof his
sons-in-law undertook), that he should be placed
in the front of the battle, and there, by his valour
should wait the decision of Providence. And
indeed the man, otherwise fraudulent, was in this
faithful to the King; for he behaved himself so valiantly,
that that day’s work procured him not only
pardon for what was past, but large rewards for
the future.”&mdash;<i>Buchanan’s Hist.</i> vol. i. p. 310.</p>

<p>It may here be mentioned, that, since the Note
on page 152 was printed off, we have learned from
one, whose researches, and connection with the
name, entitle him to express an opinion, that the
M’Kerlies of Wigtonshire are descended from
Kerlé, or Kerlie, who, with Sir William Wallace
and Stephen of Ireland, carried by assault the Fort
of the Black-Rock of Cree, or Cruggleton Castle,
and who was the last friend that clung to the fortunes
of his master. Although the records of the
burgh of Witham furnish no information on the subject,
being all of a date subsequent to the Reformation,
it is still handed down by tradition, that the
M’Kerlies were once proprietors of Cruggleton
Castle.</p>

<p>Abercrombie, who confounds John Blair with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Arnold Blair, doubts of the above lines being composed
by him. Arnold, in his <i>Relationes</i>, has certainly
given nothing of his own, his brief details,
as we have already observed, being merely extracts
from the Scotichronicon; and it is more
than probable, that as he borrowed from Fordun
in the one instance, he might also be inclined to
take the same liberty with Blair in the other. The
verses are evidently the effusion of a superior mind,
brooding over a recent calamity. They are attached
to the end of Arnold Blair’s Relationes, to
which the date of 1327 is affixed,&mdash;thus bringing
them to within 22 years of the execution of Wallace;&mdash;that
they were composed soon after that
event becomes therefore a matter of certainty.</p>

<p>The writer entertained the hope of being able
to gratify his readers with some specimens of the
chansonnettes, said to have been composed in honour
of Wallace by the Troubadours of France. He is
sorry, however, that his applications have not been
followed by the success anticipated. He will,
therefore, conclude his labours with the following
lines from an unpublished <span class="locked">manuscript:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="fn1"><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>  In the invasion of England, one Grimesby acted as
guide to the Scottish army. This person we have alluded
to at page 109, vol. i. as carrying the banner of St John
of Beverley, in the army of Edward. He was afterwards
rewarded by the Usurper with the promise of the first benefice
of twenty merks or pounds which should become
vacant in Scotland. This prospect of preferment, however,
did not prevent him from joining the liberator of his
country. He appears to have been long in the service of
England, and was most probably one of those 30,000
Scots who were sent by Alexander III. to the assistance
of Henry III., when opposed by his barons. Though it
be uncertain if he accompanied Edward to the Holy
Land, it is however pretty evident that he attended him
in his various expeditions to France; and, in his character
of pursuivant, he obtained a very intimate acquaintance
with the localities of that country, as well as of
England. His intimate knowledge of the latter rendered
his services of much importance to his countrymen.
Henry represents him as a steady and useful adherent to
Wallace, and describes him to be of great stature, and as
having acquired among the English the name of Grimesby,
on account of his grim or stern visage. This, however,
is more fanciful than correct. <i>Grimesby</i> is of Danish origin,
and though among the Scots he was called Jop, his real name
appears to have been Gilbert Grimesby. He acted as herald,
as well as guide; and often marshalled the Scottish battalions
on the eve of battle.</p></div>

with our passing over the interview which Wallace
is said to have had with Queen Margaret, during the
time his army was encamped in the north of England;
but we always wish to have some authority for what we
commit to our pages; and as we can find nothing in support
of it, either in English or Scottish records, we are inclined
to look upon it as a minstrel’s tale, introduced for
the purpose of effect. The subject excited the inquiries of
the learned Dr Jamieson, who has been at considerable
pains to ascertain whether or not such an interview actually
took place; and all his researches tend rather to
throw discredit on the affair, in addition to the doubt
which naturally arises from the silence of history. Henry,
in whose work the tale is only to be found, represents Edward
as being then in Britain, while it is agreed on all
hands that he was, at the time, prosecuting the war in
Flanders. Though the Minstrel be a favourite with us, still
we like to see his statements corroborated; and we conceive,
that the English Queen appearing in the Scottish camp in
the manner he describes, was a circumstance too flattering
to the national pride of the Scots, to be left to the pen of
one solitary narrator.</p></div>

appear to be known. Guthrie is said to have been
the ancestor of the Guthries of that Ilk, and was frequently
employed as the confidential agent of his countrymen.
</p>
<p>
Bisset is also mentioned as the progenitor of the Bissets
of that Ilk; and according to Henry, he was killed on
this occasion by the hand of Siward, who, in his turn, was
cut down by Wallace. By the chamberlain’s accounts
it appears, that one John Bisset, a poor monk of Haddington,
received from King Robert Bruce a pension of
20s. per annum for clothing. Whether this was given in
consequence of any relationship to the gallant patriot of
that name, is not stated.

<p>
The battle of Blackironside appears to have been a protracted
forest-fight for the greater part of the day; and
the heat of the weather induced the combatants at times,
as if by mutual consent, to pause amid the deadly strife.
</p>
<p>
On one of those occasions, Wallace it is said unclasped
the helmet of a dead Englishman, and, repairing to a neighbouring
fountain, still unstained with the carnage of the
day, he dipped it into the stream, and continued to carry the
water along the ranks of his fainting soldiers. When he
had in this manner allayed their thirst, he afterwards partook
himself; and declared, that the cooling beverage was
more grateful to his palate, than the richest wines he had
ever tasted. The effect which this mark of attention produced
on the minds of his followers, was evinced by the
vigour they displayed in the charge which they soon afterwards
made on the enemy.</p></div>

<p>
From the above document, it will appear that Wallace
was sole Regent; and that, when he associated the name
of the younger Sir Andrew Murray along with his own,
it may be considered as only a respectful compliment to
the memory of the gallant and patriotic father, whose example
the young warrior was thereby excited to emulate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>  This deed Baliol could have no great difficulty in
executing; for though residing in the Tower, he enjoyed
the full liberty of twenty miles round, and a princely retinue
to attend him. That he transmitted a commission
of Regency to Wallace, is not only highly probable, but
placed almost beyond a doubt, not merely from the suspicions
entertained by Edward, and the severe treatment
which Baliol latterly experienced in consequence of his
supposed duplicity, but also from the fact of Wallace
<i>possessing</i> and <i>using</i>, in his character of Regent of the
kingdom, <i>the seal</i> of the dethroned <i>monarch</i>; and that in
the presence, and with the sanction of the assembled nobility.
Evidence to this effect is furnished by the charter
granted to Alexander Scrymgeour, given in the preceding
note; and as the lands which were at that time conferred
are declared to have belonged to the <i>crown</i>, the full
and unrestricted authority with which Wallace was invested
becomes thereby the more apparent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>  Lord Hailes, on the authority of Hemingford, says
‘Temple-liston,’ and thus condescends to notice a respectable
writer:&mdash;“<i>Sir Robert Sibbald</i>, Comment. in Relat.
et Blair, p. 31, says ‘at <i>Torphichen</i>,’ because <i>Blind
Harry</i> says so. It was an admirable fancy to correct W.
Hemingford by <i>Blind Harry</i>! Had Edward fixed his
head-quarters at Torphichen, his communication with
Edinburgh and the Frith of Forth would have been
speedily cut off.”
</p>
<p>
This is scarcely doing Sir Robert justice. It is more
reasonable to suppose that he said so, after weighing the
probabilities of the case. That Torphichen was a place of
some importance, and possessed accommodation, appears
certain, from the circumstance of Wallace having, only a
few months before, assembled the Scottish Barons to a
parliament there; and it was, as has been already mentioned,
the station of a preceptory of the Templars, within
the precincts of which Edward was more likely to fix his
head-quarters, than in any part of the desolated country
around him. During his stay, we also find him employed
in conferring the honour of knighthood on a number of
young esquires;&mdash;an idea very naturally produced by his
residence in such a spot. That Edward’s communication
with Edinburgh and the Frith of Forth became thereby
liable to any interruption, is a supposition more to be
admired for simplicity, than depth of reflection. The distance
between Torphichen and Temple-liston, is but a very
few miles. Edward was at the head of an army consisting
of 7000 cavalry, and about 100,000 foot; a multitude
that could find little more than tent-room in the space
between the two places. Had the English monarch,
therefore, been the most imbecile general that ever led
men to the field,&mdash;with such a force he could have no
difficulty in keeping open his communication to a much
greater extent than what was required in such a position.
That a portion of the English army was stationed at Temple-liston,
is not to be doubted; and it seems equally certain,
that Edward made the more convenient station of
Torphichen his own head-quarters. Sir Robert, therefore,
had reason, as well as the authority of Blind Harry, in
support of his statement.</p></div>

and Angus. With respect to the first, there is certainly a
mistake, as he does not appear <i>ever</i> to have joined the
standard of Wallace, and the other, with more propriety,
may be called an Anglo-Scot. What share he may have
had in the treason, is uncertain. That the plans of Wallace
were betrayed by those in his confidence, is evident;
but who the guilty parties were, remains doubtful. The
subsequent conduct of Comyn excites a strong suspicion
against him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>  Among the various documents which his Lordship
appears to consider authentic, is the following, which he
thus introduces:&mdash;“I have seen the title of a public instrument,
which runs thus:&mdash;‘Acte contenant les responses
faites par Pierre Flotte, Seigneur de Revel, commis
par le Roy (de France) pour traitter et conferer avec les
Ambassadeurs Anglois, touchant l’execution du traité de
treve, et reparation des infractions d’icelle. Simon de Meleun
l’arbitre nommé par le Roy, offrit au Roy d’Angleterre
de delivrer tous les prisonniers Anglois en rendant
par lui le Roy de Escosse et son fils, et les Escossois detenus
en Angleterre et ailleurs, ou les mettant en la garde
d’un prelat Francois qui les gardera soubs le nom du Pape
pendant que le Pape jugera de leur differend.’ The original,
if extant, says Lord Hailes, might serve to explain
several circumstances respecting this treaty; particularly,
that Edward Baliol was in captivity, together with his father,
and that the Pope proposed himself as umpire between
Edward I. and his disobedient vassal.”
</p>
<p>
Now, the above is all good modern French, and the orthography
exactly as at present, with the exception of the
following words, <i>responses</i>, <i>traitter</i>, <i>Escosse</i>, <i>soubs</i>, which
appear to have had their spelling antiquated a little, to
give the document a venerable air;&mdash;it has, on the whole,
a very clumsy appearance, and shows that it cannot be
older than the 17th century. If the “<i>full evidence</i>” referred
to be liable to similar objections, it will not appear
very surprising, that our early writers should have been so
much in the dark respecting it.</p></div>

<p>“There are now three stones upon the grave. When the
inscription on the first had begun to wear out by the influence
of the weather, a second was put above it, with
the same inscription; and a third was lately added by
William Graham of Airth, Esq. At a little distance,
upon the left, is an unpolished stone, said to cover the remains
of the gallant knight of Bonkill.”&mdash;<i>Nimmo’s History
of Stirlingshire.</i></p>

<p>With regard to Stewart of Bonkill being buried in
Falkirk, we are inclined to be a little sceptical, not so
much from the silence of the Minstrel, as from the great
probability of his having been conveyed to Bute by the
surviving tenantry of that island. In a small ruined
chapel, about half a mile west of Rothesay, there is still
to be seen all that remains of “<i>the auld Stewarts of Bute</i>,”
where, amidst a number of dilapidated monuments, well
worth the attention of the antiquary, appears a stone figure,
said to represent the gallant knight of Bonkill, in
complete armour of the 13th century. In a recess in
the opposite wall, there is also to be seen another figure,
representing <i>Jean M’Rudrie, heiress of Bute</i>. This lady
appears to have been descended from a sea-officer, or pirate,
named <i>Rudrie</i>, who is thus noticed in the Norwegian
account of the expedition of King Haco:&mdash;“The
wind was not favourable; King Haco, however,
made Andreas Pott go before him, south to Bute, with
some small vessels, to join those he had already sent
thither. News was soon received, that they had won a
fortress, the garrison of which had capitulated, and accepted
terms of the Norwegians. There was with the
Norwegians a sea-officer called <i>Rudri</i>; he considered
Bute as his birth-right; and because he had not received
the island of the Scots, he committed many ravages, and
killed many people, and for that he was outlawed by the
Scottish King. He came to Haco and took the oaths to
him, and, with two of his brothers, became his subjects.
As soon as the garrison, after having delivered up the
stronghold, were gone away from the Norwegians, Rudri
killed nine of them, because he thought he owed them no
good will.” After the treaty between Alexander and the
Norwegians, it would seem that Rudrie had been allowed
to hold the island of Bute as a vassal of the Scottish
crown; and there is every reason to believe that the <i>Janet
M’Rudrie</i> above mentioned was either his daughter or
grand-daughter, who, by her marrying Alexander Stewart,
became the mother of Sir John Stewart of Bonkill.</p>

<p>The present noble proprietor, whose family came to the
possession of Bute in the reign of Robert II., has made
some slight repairs about the walls where these figures are
reclining. It is, however, to be regretted, that a little more
attention is not paid to the preservation of such valuable
antiques.</p>

this occasion. By the inventory of Edward’s jewels taken
in 1300, there appear 18 silver cups, and one silk girdle
richly ornamented, which are stated to have been taken
from the monastery of Cupar. This, no doubt, would form
a part of the King’s share of the booty.&mdash;Vide <i>Wardrobe

ruins of a building, known by the name of Wallace’s house.
Judging by what remains, it appears to have been of
very limited extent, and, though well calculated for security,
would afford but scanty accommodation to the inmates.
Its form is circular, and the site commands an
extensive view; it, however, could make but a precarious
resistance to an enemy possessed of the lower fortification.
From the following lines in Barbour, it appears very probable
that this was the place in which Lord William
Soulis was detained a state prisoner for life, in consequence
of his conspiring against Robert <span class="locked">Bruce:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>  Henry states, that after Wallace had driven the English
out of Dumbarton, which he accomplished by an ingenious
stratagem put in execution at night, he proceeded
towards the castle of Roseneath, which was occupied by the
enemy, and having learned that a marriage was to take
place among them on the ensuing day, he posted his men
in ambush on the road between the castle and a church,
situated on the “Garlouch” where the ceremony was to
be performed. The cavalcade approached, accompanied
by most of the soldiers of the garrison. The Scots, at the
signal of their chief, burst from their concealment, and
having with little difficulty overpowered and put their astonished
adversaries to the sword, they took possession of
the fortress, which they found amply supplied with provisions
of all kinds, intended, no doubt, for the joyous occasion.
</p>
<p>
The above anecdote induces the writer again to remark
on the accuracy of Henry’s topography. If his work be not
a faithful translation from the narrative of an eye-witness,
his knowledge of the localities of the country is truly wonderful.</p></div>

respecting the nature of the supplies required for the support
and defence of an English garrison in the 13th century,
we have made the following extract from the Wardrobe
Account of the munitions, sent on this occasion to Stirling;
viz. 1000 stockfish, 610 ling, 4 lasts herrings, 104
cheeses, 6000 onions, 30 cwt. tallow, 1 barrel honey, 11
barrels pitch, 20 lb. wax, 20 lb. cummin, 2 lb. crocus, 6

18 pieces cloth, for clothing the men, 1 piece blue cloth,
being clothing for John Sampson, constable of the castle,
2 chaplains and 1 clerk, 1000 ells linen, 30 fur-skins for
great-coats for the servants of the King’s household, stationed
in said garrison, 4 lamb skins for hoods for the use of
said constable, chaplains, and 1 clerk, 240 pair shoes, and
500 ells <span class="locked">canvas.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a>  The above goods were sent by John the son of Walter,

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>  It is very probable that Edward had evidence in his
possession of the commission of regency he had granted
to Wallace. The English monarch had too many secret
emissaries in Scotland, to remain long ignorant of a matter
of such importance. What Baliol might say to the contrary
would therefore meet with little credit; and his apparent
duplicity, no doubt, prompted the following remark, which,
according to Walsingham, Edward made use of, on delivering
him to the Nuncio. “<i>I send him to the Pope as
a perjured man, and a seducer of the people.</i>”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>  Independent of all the difficulties which Wallace had
to encounter in the Low country, the turbulent state of
the Highlands prevented him from receiving any assistance
of consequence from that quarter. The chieftains
there seemed to consider their interests as very little connected
with the safety or independence of the Lowlanders;
and they carried on their feuds with as much inveteracy, as
if no foreign enemy had been in the country. We find, that
“about the year 1299, there was an insurrection made against
the Earl of Ross, by some of the people of that
province, inhabiting the mountains called Clan-Iver-Clan-Tall-wigh,
and Clan-Leawe. The Earl of Ross made such
diligence, that he apprehended their captain, and imprisoned
him at Dingwall: which so incensed the Highlanders,
that they pursued the Earl of Ross’s second son, at Balnegowen,
took him, and carried him along prisoner with
them, thinking thereby to get their captain relieved. The
Monroes and the Dingwalls, with some others of the Earl
of Ross his dependers, gathered their forces, and pursued
the Highlanders with all diligence; so, overtaking them at
Beallogh-ne-broig, between Ferrindonell and Lochbrime,
there ensued a cruel battle, well foughten on either side.
The Clan-Iver, Clan-tall-wigh and Clan-Leaive, were almost
utterly extinguished. The Monroes had a sorrowful
victory, with a great loss of their men; and carried back
again the Earl of Ross his son. The Laird of Kildun
was there slain with seven score of the surname of Dingwall.
Divers of the Monroes were slain in the conflict;
and among the rest, there were killed eleven of the house
of Foulis, that were to succeed one another; so that the
succession of Foulis fell unto a child then lying in his
cradle. For which service the Earl of Ross gave divers
lands to the Monroes and Dingwalls.”&mdash;<i>Conflicts of the
clans.</i></p></div>

an entry of 6s. 8d. paid to Ralph de Kyrkby, the messenger
who brought to the King the conditions and surrender
of Stirling. The following notice respecting this intended
expedition appears in the same document. “To
a monk of Durham, to carry St Cuthbert’s banner into
Scotland, when the King intended to go in person to
raise the siege of Stirling Castle, 20 days, at 1s. per day.”
One of the vicars of Beverly College had 8d. per day for
carrying St John’s banner, and 1d. per day to carry it
back.</p></div>

Its sanctity was considered equal to that of the <i>black

founds a very strong argument in favour of the <i>existence</i> of
Blair’s work, and of the fidelity of Henry’s translation.
The difference in the two editions appeared so very important,
as to induce a friend of the writer to refer to the
original manuscript in the Advocates’ Library, when it was
found that the rendering of the Perth editor was strictly
conformable to the original text, “thus affording,” as the
above mentioned friend observes, “a triumphant argument

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_57" id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>  On the charge which has been made against Edward,
for destroying the records and monuments of
Scotland, Lord Hailes thus expresses himself:&mdash;“While
the English were at Scone, they carried off some of the
charters belonging to the abbey, and tore the seals from
others. This is the only well-vouched example which I
have found of any outrage on private property committed
by Edward’s army. It is mentioned in a charter of Robert
I.; and we may be assured that the outrage was not
diminished in the relating.” Had this escaped from any
other pen than that of a lawyer, it might have been considered
as proceeding from ignorance; but being from a
Judge on the Bench, we are at a loss what term to apply
to it. The charter of Robert I. (Chart. Scone, 26.) was
given in order to confirm former grants, and thus replace
those which either had been carried off, or had their seals
torn from them. To have inserted a narrative of <i>all</i> spoliations
of a similar nature, which Edward and his army
had committed in Scotland, would have been <i>irrelevant</i>;
and we conceive that the expense of engrossing into a
<i>private</i> charter what belonged to the annals of the country,
would not have been relished by the brethren of Scone.
Had a case of expenses, incurred, in a manner so uncalled
for, come under his Lordship’s review, we presume he
would have sustained the objections of the defender. All
that could appear with propriety in the charter, was an
account of the destruction of those prior grants, which
rendered a new charter necessary; and this document, if
it proves any thing, proves the wanton and destructive
malice of the invaders, when they would not permit even
private property, the destruction of which could be of no
service to themselves, to escape their violence. It would
be of no avail, where Lord Hailes is concerned, to quote
Scottish authorities in support of the charge against Edward,
as a destroyer of public records; we shall therefore
give the following extract, from the works of a learned,
intelligent, and candid Englishman&mdash;an evidence
which, we presume, few of his Lordship’s admirers will
object to:&mdash;“King Eugene VII., about the beginning of
the eighth century, is said to have ordered the depositing
of all records, and books relating to the history of Scotland,
at Icolm-kill; where he caused their old library
(much neglected and decayed) to be pulled down and
rebuilt in a very splendid manner, for this sole use and
purpose. How long they continued there, and how well
that excellent King’s design was answered, I know not;
but it is now too sad a truth, that most of these venerable
remains of antiquity are quite perished; and it is generally
agreed, that they were destroyed on three remarkable
occasions. The first of these was, when our King
Edward the First, having claimed the sovereignty of Scotland,
made a most miserable havock of the histories and
laws of that kingdom; hoping that, in a short time, nothing
should be found in all that country, but what carried
an English name and face. To this end, he forbad, on
severe penalties, the keeping of any such books or records;
and proceeded so far as even to abolish the very
name of Claudius Cæsar in his famous round temple,
which he ordered to be called, as it is to this day, Arthur’s
Hoff, pulling away the stone which preserved the memory
of that great emperor and his conquests. That a great
deal of this story is true, appears from the scarcity of
Scotch records in our State-archives in England. Amongst
the foreign treaties in the Exchequer, there are
about 70 original instruments, bagged up, and inscribed,
“Scotia ante Unionem:” And in the Tower, about 100
Rolls, relating to the affairs of that kingdom, under the
title of Scotia. The former of these begin at the reign of
Edward the First, and end with that of Queen Elizabeth;
and the latter commences as before, but falls no lower
than the reign of Edward the Fourth, the rest being to be
looked for in the Chapel of the Rolls. But these are all
the produce of our own country; and, instead of enriching
us with the spoils of our neighbours, seem rather to
prove, that King Edward had an equal spite at the ancient
records of both kingdoms&mdash;so little is there of apology to
be made for so notorious a destroyer of the public registers,
together with the private monuments, evidences, and
conveyances of lands! I do not doubt but the reason of
such barbarity has been justly enough assigned, by those
who represent him as “having a jealous eye over any
thing that might encourage his new vassals to rebel, endeavouring
to root out all memorials of the nobility, and
to embase their spirits, by concealing from them their
descent and qualities.” I have seen a manuscript list of
such records as were carried off by his order. It begins,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ista monumenta subscripta capta fuerunt in thesaurario
de Edinburg in presentia Abbatum de Dunfermelyn &amp; de
S. Cruce de Edinburg, &amp; Johannis de Lythegranes, Guil-de

Berwick per præceptum Edwardi regis Angliæ &amp; superioris

the catalogue ends: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">In quorum omnium testimonium tam

super Tynam 30 die mensis Decembris anno dom. 1292, &amp;
regni prædicti domini Edwardi regis Angliæ &amp; superioris
domini Scotiæ, 21mo.</i> The second great loss of the Scotch
records, happened upon the mighty turn of the Reformation;
when the monks, flying to Rome, carried with them
the register-books, and other ancient treasure of their respective
monasteries. The third, and killing blow, was
given them by Oliver Cromwell; who brought most of the
poor remains that were left into England; and they likewise
were mostly lost in their return by sea. See <i>Nicolson’s
Scottish Historical Library</i>, p. 71, 72, 4to Edition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_63" id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>  The existence of the bond or covenant between Bruce
and Cumyn, though subjected to the doubts of Lord
Hailes, is recorded by all our respectable authorities. The
objections of his Lordship arose from the difficulty the
parties would have experienced in effecting the contract.
“It must be held extraordinary,” says our learned annalist,
“that the two conspirators met together, should
have committed such a secret to writing, as if it had been
a legal covenant to have force in a court of justice; but
more extraordinary still, that they should have done this
at the imminent hazard of intrusting their lives and fortunes
to the fidelity of a third party; for I presume, it will
be admitted, that two Scottish barons, in that age, could
not have framed such an indenture without assistance.”
His Lordship, in his zeal to diminish the authority of preceding
historians, often forgets the manners and customs
of the age respecting which he writes, and assimilates them
too closely to those of his own times. Were it not for this,
he would have seen neither difficulty nor danger in two
barons of such extensive territorial possessions and feudal
influence, procuring a person properly qualified, and
whose secrecy, had it been doubted, they would have had
no hesitation in <i>effectually securing</i>, either by imprisonment
or otherwise. Even if their power did not extend
to this, as the bond was not left in the possession of the
drawer, where was the danger? Would any person whose
education enabled him to frame such an instrument, have
been so extremely foolish as attempt to charge two of the
most powerful noblemen of the kingdom with treason,
without the least shadow of proof to support the accusation?
Bonds of manrent were never intended to be brought
into a court of law, and all his Lordship’s experience
would not have furnished him with a single instance of
an attempt to enforce the fulfilment of such a contract by
legal means. Bonds of this kind were entered into for the
purpose of strengthening the feudal connections of the
parties; and infidelity under such compacts carried its
punishment along with it, by the want of confidence it
created among the other feudal proprietors. That such
bondsmen were looked upon with extreme jealousy by the
Legislature, is sufficiently evident from the conduct of
James II. towards Lord Douglas; “a court of justice,”
therefore, was not the place to get their penalties recognised.
</p>
<p>
The transaction is thus related by Wyntown, with whom
Barbour agrees in every particular, and by which it will
be seen, that “the two conspirators” did not “<i>meet</i> together,”
as his Lordship asserts, but were riding together to
Stirling; and the instrument was drawn and sealed the
same night in that <span class="locked">place:&mdash;</span></p>

the list of the defenders of Stirling. Emancipation from
a dungeon, and the prospect of attaining to great riches,
were no doubt powerful motives. Whether the following
relation in Henry has any subsequent connection with this
individual, we must leave our readers to determine. If
it does, he appears to have received from the hand of our
hero the recompence of his labours.
</p>

<p>
The small party of adherents which still clung to the
fortunes of Wallace and the cause of independence, were
reduced to the greatest distress for want of provisions.
Our hero had left them, in order to look out for a place
where they might obtain supplies; and, while wandering
through the wilds of Lorn, overcome by hunger and fatigue,
he threw himself down in despair at the entrance of
a forest, when the following adventure occurred to <span class="locked">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>  The circumstance of this person being the last friend
whom our hero was destined to behold, would, independent
of his own personal merits, have rendered him an object
of curiosity to a great proportion of our readers. The following
account is taken from the notes of the editor of the
Perth edition of Blind Harrie; and, as any thing which
the writer has yet met with, rather tends to confirm than
invalidate the statement, he shall submit it to the reader
in the words of the learned and intelligent author:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
“William Ker, commonly called Kerlie, or Ker Little,
was ancestor of the Kers of Kersland. He, as well as
many others, was compelled to swear the unlawful oath of
fealty to Edward, August 5. 1296.
</p>
<p>
“He joined Wallace at the castle of the Earl of Lennox,
September 1296, and went with him immediately on
his first northern expedition. He and Stephen of Ireland
were the only two of Wallace’s men who survived the battle
along the north side of the River Erne, November
1296.
</p>
<p>
“He was the constant friend and companion of Wallace
on all occasions, and is sometimes called his steward:
In 1305, when Wallace was taken prisoner at Robrastoun,
a solitary village near Glasgow, William Ker only was
with him. They were found both asleep, and Ker was
killed in the scuffle.
</p>
<p>
“Henry says, that William Ker had large inheritance
in the district of Carrick in Air-shire. That his ancestor
was brought from Ireland by King David I., and defeated,
with the assistance of seven hundred Scots, nine thousand
Norwegians who had landed at Dunmoir. Some
of the Norwegians were drowned in Doun, and others slain
upon the land. King David gave him the lands of Dunmoir
in reward of his bravery.
</p>
<p>
“It may be remarked, that Dun Hill, or, as it is commonly
called, Norman or Northman Law, a high hill on
the estate of Dunmure, in the north-east part of Fife, and
parish of Abdie, has on the top of it the remains of Danish
intrenchments. The hill on the north side declines all the
way to the river or Frith of Tay, which has Dundee at
the mouth of it. The constant tradition is, that the Danes
or Norwegians carried the spoil of the country to the top
of this hill, where the natives could have no access to them;
and after having collected it there, carried it down on the
other side to their ships in the river.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_69" id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>  “At Robroystone Sir William Wallace was betrayed
and apprehended by Sir John Menteith, a favourite of
Edward I. of England. After he was overpowered, and
before his hands were bound, it is said he threw his sword
into Robroyston loch. An oaken couple, or joist, which
made part of the barn in which the Scottish hero was taken,
is still to be seen in this neighbourhood, and may yet last
for ages.”&mdash;<i>Stat. Acc. viii.</i> 481, 482.
</p>
<p>
The latter part of the above quotation is perfectly correct.
The oaken joist was to be seen till within these ten years
past; it has now entirely disappeared, being carried off by
that tribe of pseudo-antiquarians, ycleped Relic-fanciers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>  This report may have originated in some facetious remark,
which probably escaped from him on hearing that
one William Wallace had, by the voice of his fellow-citizens,
attained to the honour of being Lord Mayor of London,
when the success of the Scots compelled Edward to
grant an extension of the liberties of his people. His election
is stated, at p. 85, vol. i. of this work, to have taken
place in 1296. This mistake the author begs leave to
correct; the election occurred in April 1298. The coincidence
is rather singular. See Lambert’s Survey of London,
vol. i. p. 167.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_72" id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>  That Edward was mean enough to subject Wallace
to a piece of mockery of this kind, appears evident, from
the same contemptible artifice, to excite derision, being
again resorted to in the case of Sir Simon Frazer, who
was not only habited in an unbecoming and ridiculous
garb, but also had “a gerland on ys heued of the newe
<i>guyse</i>.” This expression is taken from the ancient ballad
made on the execution of Frazer, as may be seen in the
account we have given of that warrior; and which seemed
evidently to allude to the recent exhibition made of Wallace,
on whose person “the newe guyse” was no doubt
first introduced;&mdash;and, as Sir Simon was executed only
about twelve months afterwards, the phrase would be perfectly
applicable, as the circumstance must have been fresh
in the minds of the people.&mdash;See <a href="#APPENDIX_L"><i>App.</i> L.</a></p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_78" id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>  This circumstance seems to have been keenly felt and
lamented, as a subject of national disgrace, by some of the
historians of England. In addition to the anathemas
poured forth by Peter Langtoft, on account of the obstinacy
of their northern neighbours&mdash;the mortification evinced
by Hardyng in the following lines, is highly complimentary
to the independent spirit of Scotland. This
acknowledged spy, and detected forger, was sent down by
his government, in the reign of Henry V., for the <i>mean</i>
purpose of stealing away the treaty with Robert Bruce, in
which the independence of Scotland was recognised.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the two last lines, the writer of the Chronicle founds
the pretensions of England to the superiority over Scotland,
on the resignation of Baliol. This title he no doubt
considered as <i>preferable</i> to any claims previously got up;
and we would recommend Dr Lingard to follow his example;
for, bad as it is, the supporters of it are not liable
to meet with those stubborn historical facts which stand
in the way of the advocates for a more venerable antiquity.
To show the sincerity which dictates this advice,
we shall revert once more to pages 443 and 444, vol. iii.
of the Doctor’s work, where we are told, on the authority
of Rymer, that the words “libertates, dignitates, honores
debiti,” &amp;c. “mean the allowances to be made, and the
honours to be shown, to the King of Scots, as often as he
came to the English court, by the command of his lord
the King of England, <i>from the moment that he crossed
the Borders till his return into his own territories</i>.” Had
the vassalage of the King of Scotland been of that unqualified
nature which the Doctor labours to establish,
how comes it that his “allowances” only commence <i>from
the moment he crossed the Border</i>, and <i>ceased</i> as soon as he
<i>returned to his own territories</i>&mdash;merely, we presume, because
<i>he was in his own territories</i>. Had it been otherwise,
he would doubtless have been found entitled to those expenses
or allowances, <i>from the time</i> he left <i>his own domicile</i>,
in whatever part of Scotland <i>that domicile</i> may have
been situated.</p>

The election of Wallace to the <i>Regency</i> did not (as is

by the Earl of Dunbar, Dr Jamieson quotes the following
authority: “When summoned by the guardian of
Scotland to attend a convention at Perth, he contemptuously
refused. Blind Harrie is supported by the Tower
Records.” Caledonia, ii. p. 246.</p>

<p class="in0">the Doctor remarks “I need scarcely say, that the earl
had given Wallace this contemptuous designation, as being
a native of the district of Kyle in Ayrshire.” It is
with much reluctance we hazard an opinion at variance
with so learned and respectable an authority as Dr Jamieson,
more particularly, where the subject is one connected
with a study, in the pursuit of which, he has acquired a lasting
and well-merited reputation. That the scoffing Earl
intended any allusion to the birth-place of Wallace, by
styling him “King of Kyle,” we would feel inclined to
question, even if it had been established that he was a
native of that district. Kyle, as well as Carrick, (two
neighbouring districts of Ayrshire), are derived from the
Celtic words, <i>Cóille</i>, and <i>Carraig</i>; the former signifying
a forest, or woody district, and the latter the rocky portion
of the country, two terms perfectly descriptive of the
localities of both districts. Wallace had always been spoken
of, by the English and their emissaries, as a leader of a
banditti. Langtoft calls him “William Waleis that maister
was of theves;” and they represented him as a sort of Robin
Hood, who had established his authority in the woods
of Scotland, in the same manner as the “King of merry
Sherwood” had done in the forest of that name. When
Gospatrick, therefore, called Wallace “King of Kyll,” we
presume he meant to call him “King of the Forest,” which
implied a king of robbers and outlaws; and that this was the
sense in which it was understood by him and the Scottish
nobles, is evident from the indignation it excited, and the
instant determination of the Guardian to revenge the insult
which had been thus offered to himself and those under his
authority. To have called him the king of the place in which
he was born, could not be considered by Wallace as a very
grievous insult, considering the situation he occupied. That
<i>Cóille</i> was at one time generally used all over Scotland to
designate a wood, or forest, is evident from the names of
many places in which the word can still be traced. It is,
however, sometimes improperly confounded with <i>Cill</i>, (a
place of interment). We are afraid that the above etymology
will not meet the approbation of the favourers of
the pretensions of Old King Coilus, but this we cannot
help; and have only to regret that the ancient language of
the country has been so little consulted by those who engage
to write its history.</p>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_105" id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>  In this explanation of the term, the writer finds himself
at variance with the opinion of Mr Tytler, who says,
“schiltron” seems to denote nothing more than a compact
body of men. As this restricted meaning of the expression
appears to have been adopted on the authority of
Hemingford, who says, “qui quidem circuli Schiltronis
vocabantur,” it is to be inferred that he has not examined
the term with his accustomed accuracy. <i>Schiltron</i> is,
without doubt, compounded of the two Saxon words
“scheld” and “roun.” When a general, in giving the
word of command, called out “Scheltron” to any portion
of his army, they would have as little difficulty in understanding
him, as a modern battalion would if ordered to
“form square.” It may also be observed, that by placing
their shields together, they derived considerable advantage,
being thereby enabled to form with greater celerity;
and when once in order, a more impenetrable figure could
not be presented to the attack of an enemy. That this is
the ancient meaning of the word, is evident from the manner
it is used by old chroniclers. Hearne, in his Glossary
to Peter Langtoft, thus explains “Schelde,” <i>shield</i>,
<i>target</i>, <i>buckler</i>, <i>protection</i>, <i>government</i>. “Sheltron,”
<i>shelter</i>, <i>covering</i>, or rather <i>shiltrons</i>, or <i>round battailes</i>.
The expression, therefore, in Hemingford, of “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">circuli
schiltronis</i>,” only shows that a man, even in a learned language,
may utter an absurdity.
</p>
<p>
In order to render the schiltron formidable in offensive
warfare, it was necessary to have the centre occupied with
archers, who, enclosed within the barrier of the spearmen,
could ply their deadly shafts in comparative security.
That this was part of the plan of Wallace to supply his
deficiency in cavalry at the battle of Falkirk, is highly
probable. By this measure, neither the superiority of the
enemy in this formidable description of force, nor the desertion
of the Scottish cavalry, would have been so severely
felt. That this arrangement did not take place, was
very likely owing to the pertinacity of Steward, who commanded
the archers, and rashly exposed himself and those
under him to the overwhelming charges of the heavy armed
squadrons of the English. This obstinacy on the part of
the knight of Bonkill, affords a very natural solution of
the feud between him and Wallace. Had the archers
been in the centre of the schiltrons, they could have returned
the murderous discharge of their enemies’ missiles
with corresponding effect, and have eventually produced
a more favourable termination to the operations of the
day.</p></div>
